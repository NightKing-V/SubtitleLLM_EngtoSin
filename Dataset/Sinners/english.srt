No, no.

20
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:33,403
Come on, son.

21
00:02:36,114 --> 00:02:37,115
It's okay.

00:02:40,452 --> 00:02:41,661
-Sammie!
-My son has felt

23
00:02:41,662 --> 00:02:42,745
the call of sin.

24
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:48,459
But the good Lord calls upon us

25
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:51,338
to be fishers of men who sin...

26
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:54,508
and show them the way.

27
00:03:03,058 --> 00:03:04,852
I want you to swear to me,

28
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:06,854
and before this congregation...

29
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:10,607
to leave those sinnin'
ways where they lie.

30
00:03:12,067 --> 00:03:14,194
I want you to
promise, right now.

31
00:03:17,322 --> 00:03:19,116
Drop the guitar, Samuel.

32
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:25,706
In the name of God.

33
00:03:30,669 --> 00:03:31,794
Let it go, Samuel.

34
00:03:34,715 --> 00:03:35,883
Put it down.

Good mornin', Miss Beatrice.

40
00:04:13,462 --> 00:04:14,630
You gonna tell me
where you playin'

41
00:04:14,713 --> 00:04:16,753
or am I gonna have to hear
it through the grapevine?

42
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:18,818
You have a good one, Beatrice.

43
00:04:18,926 --> 00:04:20,719
I'll see you at service
tomorrow morning.

44
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:23,096
I guess the grapevine it is.

45
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:36,652
Mornin', Ma.

46
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:37,818
Mornin', baby.

47
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:43,159
Don't put that on
your body, Samuel.

48
00:04:43,242 --> 00:04:44,326
Come on, Ma. Soap is soap.

49
00:04:44,493 --> 00:04:45,619
It'll dry ya out.

50
00:04:45,786 --> 00:04:47,496
I'll put this on
while it's still wet.

51
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:49,581
Boy, you ain't got the sense

52
00:04:49,748 --> 00:04:50,916
God gave a goose.

53
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:52,292
<i>Go on. Get.</i>

54
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:54,211
Hey, Mama said get up.

55
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:56,792
Morning, Sammie.

56
00:04:59,174 --> 00:05:00,217
Don't wanna wake.

57
00:06:18,295 --> 00:06:19,379
You Hogwood?

58
00:06:24,134 --> 00:06:25,135
You boys twins?

59
00:06:26,512 --> 00:06:27,792
Nah, we cousins.

60
00:06:29,014 --> 00:06:30,140
Well.

61
00:06:30,557 --> 00:06:31,558
Here she is.

62
00:06:32,434 --> 00:06:34,978
He moved a ton of timber a
month back in his heyday.

63
00:06:35,145 --> 00:06:36,745
Workers lived upstairs.

64
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:39,316
Say, what are you fellas

65
00:06:39,483 --> 00:06:40,803
planning on doing
with the place?

66
00:06:46,323 --> 00:06:47,533
Y'all washed these floors?

67
00:06:48,867 --> 00:06:49,868
Yeah.

68
00:06:50,035 --> 00:06:51,078
What was on 'em?

69
00:06:54,081 --> 00:06:56,291
I thought y'all was dead
set on buying the place.

70
00:06:57,501 --> 00:06:58,661
More time I spend with y'all,

71
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:00,879
the less sure I am you
boys are serious about it.

72
00:07:02,381 --> 00:07:04,132
Ain't no "boys" here.

73
00:07:04,299 --> 00:07:05,634
Just grown men.

74
00:07:05,801 --> 00:07:07,135
With grown-men money.

75
00:07:07,302 --> 00:07:08,595
And grown-men bullets.

76
00:07:23,402 --> 00:07:24,778
I didn't mean nothin' by it.

77
00:07:26,196 --> 00:07:27,781
Just the way we talk down here.

78
00:07:28,532 --> 00:07:29,533
We'll take it.

79
00:07:31,994 --> 00:07:33,036
The mill, the equipment,

80
00:07:33,203 --> 00:07:35,122
and the land that
it's standing on.

81
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:37,916
Well, damn.

82
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:39,710
Now, understand,
it's the last dime

83
00:07:39,877 --> 00:07:41,170
you ever gonna see from us.

84
00:07:41,336 --> 00:07:42,337
And if we see you,

85
00:07:42,504 --> 00:07:44,131
or any one of your Klan buddies

86
00:07:44,298 --> 00:07:46,049
cross our property line,

87
00:07:46,216 --> 00:07:47,635
we gonna kill 'em
right where they stand.

88
00:07:49,094 --> 00:07:50,095
Shit.

89
00:07:50,846 --> 00:07:52,598
Klan don't exist no more.

90
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:11,824
Mornin', Pop.

91
00:08:13,452 --> 00:08:14,912
You're up awful early, son.

92
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:16,079
Like you say...

93
00:08:16,246 --> 00:08:17,247
"Jump on the work,

94
00:08:17,414 --> 00:08:18,582
don't let the work jump on you."

95
00:08:18,665 --> 00:08:19,666
That's right.

96
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:21,335
Finished my quota for the day.

97
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:28,342
Yeah. I brought it in here.

98
00:08:29,384 --> 00:08:32,011
I want you to help me
give my sermon tomorrow.

99
00:08:36,265 --> 00:08:38,936
First Corinthians, 10:13.

100
00:08:42,105 --> 00:08:43,357
Read.

101
00:08:44,608 --> 00:08:46,485
"No temptation...

102
00:08:46,652 --> 00:08:47,945
has overtaken you,

103
00:08:48,111 --> 00:08:50,239
except what is
common to mankind.

104
00:08:50,405 --> 00:08:51,865
God is faithful.

105
00:08:53,242 --> 00:08:54,410
He will not let you be tempted

106
00:08:54,493 --> 00:08:55,661
beyond what you can bear.

107
00:08:56,703 --> 00:08:57,996
But when you're tempted...

108
00:08:58,163 --> 00:08:59,248
he will also provide a way out

109
00:08:59,331 --> 00:09:00,457
so that you can endure it."

110
00:09:01,667 --> 00:09:04,044
Now, Pop, if you don't
mind, I'm gon' be late.

111
00:09:04,211 --> 00:09:05,212
Late for what, boy?

112
00:09:06,797 --> 00:09:08,132
Where you gotta be
that's more important

113
00:09:08,215 --> 00:09:09,591
than being in the House of God?

114
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,595
I been workin' all week, Pop.

115
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:18,225
Wanna be free of
all this for a day.

116
00:09:18,392 --> 00:09:19,434
To play music?

117
00:09:20,686 --> 00:09:21,687
For drunkards?

118
00:09:22,437 --> 00:09:24,148
Philanderers, who shirk
their responsibilities

119
00:09:24,231 --> 00:09:25,232
to their families

120
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:27,150
so they can sweat
all over each other?

121
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:31,405
I'll be back in time for
service in the morning.

122
00:09:33,407 --> 00:09:34,449
Son?

123
00:09:39,663 --> 00:09:41,582
You keep dancing
with the Devil...

124
00:09:43,584 --> 00:09:45,335
one day, he's gonna
follow you home.

125
00:09:49,381 --> 00:09:50,901
Hey, lil' cousin, come on out.

126
00:09:52,467 --> 00:09:54,386
Got two dollars out
here waitin' on a dime.

127
00:09:55,554 --> 00:09:56,555
Samuel!

128
00:10:00,309 --> 00:10:02,186
Aw, don't you worry
now, Uncle Jed.

129
00:10:03,312 --> 00:10:05,480
We gon' get him back
to you in one piece.

130
00:10:13,405 --> 00:10:14,573
Well, how you be?

131
00:10:14,865 --> 00:10:16,533
Your daddy doin' right by you?

132
00:10:17,826 --> 00:10:19,245
Say, he not putting his
hands on you, is he?

133
00:10:19,328 --> 00:10:21,079
Nah, man. Nothin' too much.

134
00:10:22,414 --> 00:10:23,624
What about the little ones?

135
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:25,375
Only when they deserve it.

136
00:10:25,542 --> 00:10:27,961
Well, Ma usually hands
out the whoopin's.

137
00:10:28,086 --> 00:10:30,964
Good. Well, Uncle
Jed always been good.

138
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:32,132
Yeah.

139
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:35,469
So, tell me about Chicago.

140
00:10:35,636 --> 00:10:37,638
I heard they ain't
got Jim Crow up there.

141
00:10:38,722 --> 00:10:40,599
Black man can go where he wants.

142
00:10:42,017 --> 00:10:43,477
Listen, boy, you can't
be believin' everything

143
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,686
that you hear.

144
00:10:45,479 --> 00:10:47,398
Town'll fill your head up
with this make-believe,

145
00:10:47,481 --> 00:10:48,857
but me and your cousin,

146
00:10:49,024 --> 00:10:50,484
we gon' give it to you straight.

147
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,361
Chicago ain't shit

148
00:10:52,528 --> 00:10:53,863
but Mississippi
with tall buildings

149
00:10:53,946 --> 00:10:55,197
instead of plantations.

150
00:10:57,991 --> 00:10:59,591
And that's why we
came back home.

151
00:11:00,285 --> 00:11:02,579
Figured we might as well
deal with the devil we know.

152
00:11:39,366 --> 00:11:41,034
{\an8}Don't move.

153
00:11:54,047 --> 00:11:55,632
How 'bout you leave
that truck to us?

154
00:12:04,933 --> 00:12:06,435
Shit. Cracker showin' up late

155
00:12:06,602 --> 00:12:07,978
already got us behind schedule.

156
00:12:09,104 --> 00:12:10,689
I'm thinkin' we
just set up tonight.

157
00:12:10,856 --> 00:12:11,899
Open up next weekend.

158
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:14,067
Nah, fuck that. It's
gotta be tonight.

159
00:12:14,193 --> 00:12:15,903
Grand opening, start
this shit with a bang.

160
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:17,571
Or we start with a misfire.

161
00:12:18,488 --> 00:12:19,656
Look at that sky.

162
00:12:21,283 --> 00:12:23,327
That's a mighty fine day
to be free, ain't it?

163
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:25,662
Our own juke joint.

164
00:12:26,496 --> 00:12:28,165
For us, and by us.

165
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:30,125
Just like we always wanted.

166
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:35,714
Only chance we got
if we split up.

167
00:12:36,673 --> 00:12:37,758
Well, who gon' watch the truck

168
00:12:37,841 --> 00:12:38,968
while I'm in there
talking to the Chows?

169
00:12:39,051 --> 00:12:40,302
Nigga, just let
'em see it's you.

170
00:12:40,385 --> 00:12:41,679
We've been gone a
long time, Stack.

171
00:12:41,762 --> 00:12:43,847
Seven years ain't long
enough to forget about us.

172
00:12:44,848 --> 00:12:45,849
All right.

173
00:12:47,184 --> 00:12:49,304
Watch this fool. Make sure
he don't get in no trouble.

174
00:12:49,478 --> 00:12:51,230
You big enough to
take me now, huh?

175
00:12:51,396 --> 00:12:52,516
I'll do what I can.

176
00:12:52,606 --> 00:12:53,815
Nah, you'll do what you told.

177
00:12:54,775 --> 00:12:56,985
You keep your eyes open for
anybody staring too long.

178
00:12:57,152 --> 00:12:59,032
This nigga don't know how
to watch his own back.

179
00:13:00,989 --> 00:13:02,229
-I love you.
-I love you, too.

180
00:13:02,324 --> 00:13:03,825
-Be careful.
-I will.

181
00:13:07,579 --> 00:13:08,789
You with me.

182
00:14:13,854 --> 00:14:14,855
Hey, little girl.

183
00:14:16,607 --> 00:14:17,691
Come here.

184
00:14:20,485 --> 00:14:21,528
Where you from?

185
00:14:21,653 --> 00:14:22,696
Shelby.

186
00:14:22,863 --> 00:14:24,281
You heard of the
Smokestack Twins?

187
00:14:24,448 --> 00:14:25,532
Of course.

188
00:14:25,699 --> 00:14:27,784
Good. I'm Smoke.

189
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:30,996
No, no, no, now. You're
not in no trouble.

190
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:33,500
See, I'm trying to put
some money in your pocket.

191
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:37,115
See, I'mma need you to come
sit in this truck right here.

192
00:14:38,295 --> 00:14:40,672
And if somebody come and
look a little too long...

193
00:14:40,839 --> 00:14:42,519
I want you to lean on
this horn, all right?

194
00:14:42,633 --> 00:14:43,634
Can you do that for me?

195
00:14:45,219 --> 00:14:46,220
Can you tell time?

196
00:14:47,095 --> 00:14:48,514
I'mma pay you ten cents

197
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:49,920
for every minute that I'm gone.

198
00:14:50,641 --> 00:14:52,518
-Will that work for you?
-Yes, sir.

199
00:14:52,684 --> 00:14:53,810
No, ma'am.

200
00:14:54,186 --> 00:14:55,729
See, we talkin' numbers now.

201
00:14:55,896 --> 00:14:58,815
And numbers always gotta be in
conversation with each other.

202
00:14:58,982 --> 00:15:00,025
You understand?

203
00:15:00,234 --> 00:15:01,818
You gotta negotiate.

204
00:15:01,985 --> 00:15:04,905
Now, ten cents just
won't work for you.

205
00:15:05,656 --> 00:15:07,115
Talk another number back to me.

206
00:15:07,658 --> 00:15:08,659
Fitty cent.

207
00:15:08,825 --> 00:15:11,161
Twenty cents. Best I can do.

208
00:15:11,328 --> 00:15:12,829
We got a deal?

209
00:15:12,996 --> 00:15:14,456
Good. Jump in.

210
00:15:19,211 --> 00:15:20,796
Remember, lean on that horn.

211
00:15:42,818 --> 00:15:44,444
You not little Lisa, is you?

212
00:15:44,611 --> 00:15:46,029
Guilty as charged.

213
00:15:46,196 --> 00:15:47,281
-Mornin', Sarah.
-Mornin'!

214
00:15:47,364 --> 00:15:49,491
-Your daddy here?
-Daddy!

215
00:15:50,409 --> 00:15:51,410
What?

216
00:15:52,995 --> 00:15:54,037
Bo Chow.

217
00:15:54,204 --> 00:15:56,373
Look what the damn
cat dragged in.

218
00:16:00,419 --> 00:16:01,545
What can I do for you?

219
00:16:01,712 --> 00:16:02,992
We throwin' a big event tonight.

220
00:16:03,088 --> 00:16:04,215
-What do you need?
-I need catfish

221
00:16:04,298 --> 00:16:05,298
for a hundred people.

222
00:16:05,424 --> 00:16:06,509
Y'all do good up in Chicago?

223
00:16:06,592 --> 00:16:07,718
I heard about some of them

224
00:16:07,885 --> 00:16:09,285
casinos up there.
Y'all hit it big?

225
00:16:12,556 --> 00:16:14,892
We hit. Just not the
way you thinking.

226
00:16:15,392 --> 00:16:16,643
What kind of way?

227
00:16:18,604 --> 00:16:19,605
Shit.

228
00:16:25,986 --> 00:16:27,546
-They stealin'!
-Mm-hm.

229
00:16:27,654 --> 00:16:28,864
Watch my fingers, fool.

230
00:16:28,947 --> 00:16:30,407
I'm trying to make sure they
ain't watchin' that shit.

231
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:31,575
Man, just get your
own damn thing, bro.

232
00:16:31,658 --> 00:16:33,327
-I'm trying to help you.
-Watch it, man.

233
00:16:34,536 --> 00:16:35,787
Fuck you going, nigger?

234
00:16:35,954 --> 00:16:37,314
Bet this bullet'll
beat you there.

235
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:41,084
You shot me. Mother...

236
00:16:44,004 --> 00:16:45,005
Smoke.

237
00:16:45,547 --> 00:16:47,799
Terry? Boy, how you been?

238
00:16:48,342 --> 00:16:50,222
I was doin' better 'fore
you shot me in the ass.

239
00:16:50,344 --> 00:16:51,846
Why in the hell you trying
to boost from my truck?

240
00:16:51,929 --> 00:16:53,138
This your truck?

241
00:16:53,764 --> 00:16:54,849
I didn't know it was your truck.

242
00:16:54,932 --> 00:16:56,016
-I swear, Smoke.
-Bullshit.

243
00:16:56,099 --> 00:16:57,100
I told you it was his.

244
00:16:57,267 --> 00:16:59,270
Wait, wait, Smoke. I thought,
I thought she was lyin'.

245
00:16:59,353 --> 00:17:01,513
Y'all was supposed to be in
Chicago workin' for Capone.

246
00:17:03,315 --> 00:17:04,525
Yeah, we back now.

247
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:14,952
Goddamn! What you do that for?

248
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:16,517
Can't have some
nigga talkin' about

249
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:18,247
how he almost robbed the Twins.

250
00:17:18,413 --> 00:17:19,582
Not without a limp
to show for it.

251
00:17:19,665 --> 00:17:21,292
-Well, who gon' patch me up?
-Shit!

252
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:22,376
I ain't got no money.

253
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:24,302
What if I get sepsis or
some shit in the ass?

254
00:17:24,461 --> 00:17:26,621
Y'all scoot on out the street.
Put some pressure on it.

255
00:17:28,715 --> 00:17:30,676
-Get up, boy.
-Nigga, I need help!

256
00:17:30,759 --> 00:17:32,594
Get up, fool. Get
out the street.

257
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:36,307
Doc Teddy still
live 'round here?

258
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:37,390
Yeah.

259
00:17:37,516 --> 00:17:38,956
I just shot a couple
niggas outside.

260
00:17:39,393 --> 00:17:42,187
If they gon' live, they
gon' need some patching up.

261
00:17:42,771 --> 00:17:43,981
Yeah, we can take
care of that.

262
00:17:44,064 --> 00:17:45,065
Anything else?

263
00:17:46,441 --> 00:17:48,443
Yeah, we gon' need a sign too.

264
00:17:48,861 --> 00:17:50,461
You think Grace'd be
up to making us one?

265
00:17:50,863 --> 00:17:51,983
When would you need it done?

266
00:17:52,155 --> 00:17:53,156
Tonight.

267
00:17:53,866 --> 00:17:55,492
Lisa. Go get your mama.

268
00:17:58,495 --> 00:18:01,415
<i>Y'all gon' have
food, drink, music.</i>

269
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:02,708
<i>Is y'all gon' be playing?</i>

270
00:18:02,875 --> 00:18:05,961
<i>You say. Cards, dice,
even got a roulette.</i>

271
00:18:13,927 --> 00:18:15,762
Do nothing but
shoot each other up.

272
00:18:15,929 --> 00:18:16,930
Glory be,

273
00:18:17,097 --> 00:18:19,516
I have no animosity towards
colored folk, but if they...

274
00:18:20,267 --> 00:18:22,102
Mama, Daddy wants you.

275
00:18:22,519 --> 00:18:23,919
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

276
00:18:26,648 --> 00:18:28,942
Used to be that they
had their side of town

277
00:18:29,109 --> 00:18:30,110
and we had ours.

278
00:18:44,917 --> 00:18:46,001
I can't feel my leg,

279
00:18:46,084 --> 00:18:47,920
I'm gonna have to
hop all around town!

280
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:49,671
Oh, yeah.

281
00:18:49,838 --> 00:18:51,465
We definitely oughta
try bring him.

282
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:54,843
You know, there's
two men out there.

283
00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:56,261
Look like they been shot.

284
00:18:56,428 --> 00:18:57,429
That'll be my doin'.

285
00:18:57,596 --> 00:18:58,764
I done already gave Bo the money

286
00:18:58,847 --> 00:18:59,848
to get 'em patched up.

287
00:19:00,224 --> 00:19:01,824
Why you gotta come
here bringin' trouble?

288
00:19:01,975 --> 00:19:03,810
Trouble ain't all he bringing.

289
00:19:04,394 --> 00:19:05,395

290
00:19:05,896 --> 00:19:07,064
How you payin' for this?

291
00:19:07,231 --> 00:19:09,691
And he wants you to
make a sign for him.

292
00:19:09,858 --> 00:19:11,568
Rush job. Gon' cost ya.

293
00:19:11,985 --> 00:19:12,986
I'm listenin'.

294
00:19:13,153 --> 00:19:14,153
Twenty.

295
00:19:14,279 --> 00:19:16,073
Fifteen for the front door
sign and five for the menu.

296
00:19:16,156 --> 00:19:17,241
Ten. Seven for the
front door sign,

297
00:19:17,324 --> 00:19:18,325
three for the menu.

298
00:19:18,492 --> 00:19:19,618
-Sixteen.
-Fifteen.

299
00:19:19,785 --> 00:19:20,786
Done.

300
00:19:21,328 --> 00:19:23,080
Oh. We only got one
color, by the way.

301
00:19:25,082 --> 00:19:26,124
What color you got?

302
00:19:26,625 --> 00:19:27,626
Red.

303
00:19:28,502 --> 00:19:30,212
-Thirteen.
-14.50.

304
00:19:33,507 --> 00:19:36,343
Fourteen. Throw in these
flowers right here...

305
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:37,553
and we got a deal.

306
00:19:38,512 --> 00:19:39,513
Done.

307
00:19:41,557 --> 00:19:42,558
Where's Stack?

308
00:19:42,891 --> 00:19:43,931
All right, listen.

309
00:19:44,059 --> 00:19:45,435
Every cooze got a button on it,

310
00:19:45,602 --> 00:19:46,603
towards the top.

311
00:19:47,271 --> 00:19:49,606
If you wanna keep a
woman, you find it...

312
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:51,441
Lick that.

313
00:19:51,608 --> 00:19:54,403
Not too hard. Not
too soft, either.

314
00:19:54,736 --> 00:19:56,655
You ever had a scoop of that
ice cream from downtown?

315
00:19:56,738 --> 00:19:57,739
Uh-huh.

316
00:19:57,906 --> 00:19:59,506
'Bout the same pressure
you put on that.

317
00:19:59,908 --> 00:20:00,909
Like it taste good,

318
00:20:01,076 --> 00:20:03,236
but you don't want it gone
too quickly, you understand?

319
00:20:04,496 --> 00:20:05,789
Hey, how fast this thing drive?

320
00:20:06,206 --> 00:20:07,291
Too damn fast.

321
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:09,251
Why? You wanna drive?

322
00:20:09,418 --> 00:20:10,503
Come on, you know I wanna drive.

323
00:20:10,586 --> 00:20:12,588
Later. On the way back.

324
00:20:12,754 --> 00:20:14,394
-On the way back.
-All right, all right.

325
00:20:16,383 --> 00:20:17,635
You always said
you would tell me

326
00:20:17,718 --> 00:20:19,478
what happened to your
daddy when I got older.

327
00:20:20,971 --> 00:20:22,139
Well, I guess I'm older.

328
00:20:25,767 --> 00:20:26,852
Y'all really kill him?

329
00:20:32,566 --> 00:20:33,942
Nah, we ain't kill him.

330
00:20:35,485 --> 00:20:36,486
Smoke did.

331
00:20:38,155 --> 00:20:39,656
Our daddy knocked
me unconscious.

332
00:20:40,282 --> 00:20:41,742
By the time I came to,

333
00:20:41,909 --> 00:20:43,309
Smoke was halfway
done buryin' him.

334
00:20:44,411 --> 00:20:45,412
He used to beat y'all?

335
00:20:45,579 --> 00:20:46,580
Me, mostly.

336
00:20:47,414 --> 00:20:48,498
But he ain't mean it.

337
00:20:51,752 --> 00:20:53,472
See you been takin'
good care of that thing.

338
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:57,299
Hey, I can't thank
y'all enough for this.

339
00:20:58,091 --> 00:20:59,092
Plays so right.

340
00:20:59,927 --> 00:21:01,167
Where'd I get this from anyway?

341
00:21:02,387 --> 00:21:04,973
Yeah, that's, uh,
Charley Patton's guitar.

342
00:21:05,599 --> 00:21:07,268
Me and my brother won it
off him in a card game.

343
00:21:07,351 --> 00:21:08,519
Hold on, Stack.

344
00:21:09,978 --> 00:21:10,979
You mean to tell me

345
00:21:11,146 --> 00:21:12,273
I had Charley Patton's
guitar this whole time?

346
00:21:12,356 --> 00:21:13,357
Swear 'fore God,

347
00:21:13,524 --> 00:21:14,525
-in your hands.
-Nah.

348
00:21:14,691 --> 00:21:15,943
Now let's see if you
can play like him.

349
00:21:16,026 --> 00:21:17,111
-Right here?
-Yeah, right now. Come on.

350
00:21:17,194 --> 00:21:19,029
All right. Come on. Watch this.

00:22:21,758 --> 00:22:22,843
Let's go. Take hold.

360
00:22:26,096 --> 00:22:27,556
-Thanks, Twin.
-Yep.

361
00:22:29,391 --> 00:22:31,602
Oh. Is that Delta Slim?

362
00:22:41,111 --> 00:22:42,279
Delta Slim.

363
00:22:46,116 --> 00:22:48,285
Yeah, I thank you
for your generosity.

364
00:22:54,333 --> 00:22:55,876
I guess that Chicago wind

365
00:22:56,752 --> 00:22:58,962
blew your Black asses
back down here, huh?

366
00:23:01,048 --> 00:23:02,049
Who the boy?

367
00:23:02,216 --> 00:23:04,801
This my little cousin.
Preacherboy Sammie.

368
00:23:04,968 --> 00:23:08,931
Happens to be the finest
blues player in all the Delta.

369
00:23:09,556 --> 00:23:11,642
I got socks older
than this here boy.

370
00:23:13,352 --> 00:23:15,854
What the hell he
know about the blues?

371
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,944
I can show you better
than I can tell you.

372
00:23:22,027 --> 00:23:24,112
Hold up, now. Put
that motherfucker...

373
00:23:24,279 --> 00:23:25,280
Put that away.

374
00:23:25,447 --> 00:23:26,448
Get, get.

375
00:23:26,615 --> 00:23:28,015
Now, this here my
patch right here.

376
00:23:28,116 --> 00:23:30,619
Now, you wasn't his cousin
and a young pup to boot,

377
00:23:30,786 --> 00:23:32,871
I'd cut your ass
too thin to fry.

378
00:23:33,038 --> 00:23:34,165
And you threaten him again...

379
00:23:34,248 --> 00:23:35,791
I'mma make your drunk ass
swallow that harmonica.

380
00:23:38,919 --> 00:23:40,462
You still nice with them keys?

381
00:23:41,088 --> 00:23:42,214
Depend on who you ask.

382
00:23:43,674 --> 00:23:47,427
I'll give you $20 to come
play at our juke tonight.

383
00:23:48,512 --> 00:23:49,805
Yeah, I wish I could.

384
00:23:50,556 --> 00:23:51,849
I'mma be at Messenger's tonight,

385
00:23:51,974 --> 00:23:53,976
same as I am every
Saturday night.

386
00:23:54,142 --> 00:23:55,686
What they pay you?

387
00:23:56,311 --> 00:23:57,312
For a gangster,

388
00:23:57,479 --> 00:23:58,564
you sure ask a lot of questions.

389
00:23:58,647 --> 00:24:00,941
They ain't paying you
$20 a night, I know that.

390
00:24:01,108 --> 00:24:02,776
You ain't paying no $20 a night.

391
00:24:04,069 --> 00:24:06,572
You payin' $20, maybe, tonight.

392
00:24:08,615 --> 00:24:10,117
I ain't never
heard of your juke.

393
00:24:10,868 --> 00:24:13,912
Maybe it's here tonight,
is it here tomorrow night?

394
00:24:14,079 --> 00:24:15,664
The week after that? Nah.

395
00:24:16,582 --> 00:24:18,209
I been at Messenger's
every Saturday night

396
00:24:18,292 --> 00:24:19,293
for the last ten years.

397
00:24:19,877 --> 00:24:21,044
Messenger's gon' be there

398
00:24:21,211 --> 00:24:22,963
another ten years
after that, at least.

399
00:24:24,381 --> 00:24:25,549
Shit.

400
00:24:25,716 --> 00:24:27,801
That's probably
more time than I got

401
00:24:28,594 --> 00:24:30,095
left on this earth, Stack.

402
00:24:30,721 --> 00:24:33,891
I play, and I get as much
corn liquor as I can drink.

403
00:24:35,934 --> 00:24:36,935
A sinner like me,

404
00:24:37,102 --> 00:24:38,342
I can't ask for more than that.

405
00:24:40,397 --> 00:24:42,191
Know what, Slim?
I'll drink to that.

406
00:24:52,367 --> 00:24:53,368
Ooh.

407
00:24:54,953 --> 00:24:55,954
What you got there, boy?

408
00:24:56,121 --> 00:24:58,832
Oh, this? It's a Irish beer.

409
00:24:58,999 --> 00:25:01,251
Straight from the
north side of Chicago.

410
00:25:04,671 --> 00:25:05,714
You sayin' that's beer?

411
00:25:05,881 --> 00:25:08,175
Wind didn't bring us
down here empty-handed.

412
00:25:10,719 --> 00:25:12,054
Give me that.

413
00:25:21,897 --> 00:25:23,857
My goodness.

414
00:25:24,149 --> 00:25:26,360
I got 500 more bottles
just like that.

415
00:25:26,527 --> 00:25:27,569
Ice cold.

416
00:25:28,779 --> 00:25:30,155
Say we pay you $40 a night.

417
00:25:30,322 --> 00:25:31,907
And all the beer
that you can drink.

418
00:25:32,074 --> 00:25:33,283
After that, no strings.

419
00:25:33,784 --> 00:25:34,785
You act now,

420
00:25:34,952 --> 00:25:36,912
I'll even let you finish
that bottle in your hand.

421
00:25:39,248 --> 00:25:40,832
Ha!

422
00:25:48,131 --> 00:25:49,132
Ha!

423
00:25:49,341 --> 00:25:51,927
These two gon' be playin'
down at the old sawmill.

424
00:25:52,511 --> 00:25:54,304
It's the grand openin'
of our new joint.

425
00:25:54,888 --> 00:25:56,181
Club Juke.

426
00:25:56,348 --> 00:25:58,851
We gon' have us a
battle of the blues.

427
00:26:00,227 --> 00:26:02,187
It's gon' be a real
ring-a-ding-ding.

428
00:26:02,354 --> 00:26:03,480
Just for us.

429
00:26:20,038 --> 00:26:21,498
-Y'all ready to eat?
-Yeah!

430
00:26:21,665 --> 00:26:23,500
-Y'all ready to drank?
-Yeah!

431
00:26:23,667 --> 00:26:25,336
Y'all ready to sweat
till y'all stank?

432
00:26:25,419 --> 00:26:26,420
Yeah.

433
00:26:27,462 --> 00:26:28,672
All right.

434
00:26:28,839 --> 00:26:30,674
We gon' get funky like a
Mississippi donkey, y'all.

435
00:26:31,925 --> 00:26:34,428
Get a drink on the Twins
when you get there.

436
00:26:34,595 --> 00:26:35,678
I like it. Where you
get that one from?

437
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:36,847
What I'm sayin', now.

438
00:26:37,014 --> 00:26:38,098
Gotta do what you gotta do.

439
00:26:38,265 --> 00:26:39,266
You gotta.

440
00:26:40,392 --> 00:26:41,768
I've seen you somewhere before.

441
00:26:41,935 --> 00:26:43,562
Maybe.

442
00:26:44,396 --> 00:26:45,480
You sing, don't you?

443
00:26:47,065 --> 00:26:48,385
-Time to time.
-Mm-hmm.

444
00:26:48,775 --> 00:26:49,818
I'm Preacherboy.

445
00:26:54,406 --> 00:26:55,657
Pearline.

446
00:26:56,450 --> 00:26:58,202
Pearline. Mm.

447
00:26:59,161 --> 00:27:00,370
I'm married, by the way.

448
00:27:00,871 --> 00:27:01,872
Happily?

449
00:27:02,539 --> 00:27:03,707
Careful, boy.

450
00:27:04,583 --> 00:27:06,543
You gon' bite off more
than you can chew.

451
00:27:09,421 --> 00:27:10,861
Maybe I'll see you tonight.

452
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:19,265
Then we'll take it from there.

453
00:27:19,348 --> 00:27:20,433
I'mma hold you to that, now.

454
00:27:20,516 --> 00:27:21,600
It's gonna be a night
you never forget.

455
00:27:21,683 --> 00:27:22,768
Hey, let me go see
about my money.

456
00:27:22,851 --> 00:27:23,936
Hey, go on and get your money.

457
00:27:24,019 --> 00:27:26,146
Hey, hey, hey. There's a
white woman staring at you.

458
00:27:27,189 --> 00:27:28,440
Shit.

459
00:27:28,732 --> 00:27:30,359
Uh, you sure she white?

460
00:27:32,236 --> 00:27:33,487
She walkin' over here right now.

461
00:27:33,570 --> 00:27:34,655
All right, now here's
what we're gonna do...

462
00:27:34,738 --> 00:27:36,698
Excuse me, boy. Is
this here Smoke?

463
00:27:37,991 --> 00:27:39,201
Or is this Stack?

464
00:27:39,368 --> 00:27:40,410
Don't, don't look at her.

465
00:27:40,577 --> 00:27:42,162
Just go over there
and keep playing.

466
00:27:42,871 --> 00:27:44,081
Yeah, it's okay.

467
00:27:47,084 --> 00:27:49,086
-You know I waited for you.
-Yeah, well,

468
00:27:49,253 --> 00:27:50,421
I don't know why in the
hell you'd go and do that.

469
00:27:50,504 --> 00:27:51,797
Because you told
me you loved me.

470
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,507
Yeah, well, I told you to stay
the fuck away from me, too,

471
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:54,884
but I guess you
didn't hear that part.

472
00:27:54,967 --> 00:27:55,968
I heard you.

473
00:27:57,010 --> 00:27:58,136
I heard you loud and clear,

474
00:27:58,303 --> 00:27:59,597
but then you stuck
your tongue in my cooze

475
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,014
and fucked me so hard,

476
00:28:01,139 --> 00:28:02,349
I figured you changed your mind.

477
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:03,559
Keep your voice down, now.

478
00:28:04,184 --> 00:28:05,853
It's not exactly
how I remember it.

479
00:28:06,019 --> 00:28:07,521
Oh, it ain't? Remember
falling asleep

480
00:28:07,688 --> 00:28:08,768
with your head on my chest?

481
00:28:09,147 --> 00:28:10,232
Leaving in the
middle of the night

482
00:28:10,315 --> 00:28:11,316
without a fucking word?

483
00:28:11,650 --> 00:28:13,210
The hell are you
doing back here, Mary?

484
00:28:15,112 --> 00:28:16,780
I buried my mama
yesterday, Stack.

485
00:28:18,866 --> 00:28:20,284
Figured I might see
you and Smoke there,

486
00:28:20,367 --> 00:28:21,827
as much as she looked
after you both.

487
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:22,995
But I guess y'all love lasted

488
00:28:23,078 --> 00:28:24,288
as long as y'all could
get something out of her.

489
00:28:24,371 --> 00:28:26,748
You right. That's all she was.

490
00:28:26,915 --> 00:28:29,710
Food, a warm bed.

491
00:28:31,587 --> 00:28:33,172
Rot in hell, Stack.

492
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:34,923
Shit, I will.

493
00:28:38,135 --> 00:28:40,053
You know, and save your
triflin' ass a room.

494
00:28:40,554 --> 00:28:43,390
Shit, right next to me. Shit.

495
00:28:43,557 --> 00:28:44,558
Hey, Stack.

496
00:28:45,601 --> 00:28:46,768
Hm?

497
00:28:47,853 --> 00:28:48,854
Maybe she ain't white.

498
00:28:49,771 --> 00:28:50,939
Boy, let's get to gettin'.

499
00:28:51,106 --> 00:28:52,149
Come on, Slim.

500
00:28:52,316 --> 00:28:53,596
Still got one more stop to make.

501
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:02,534
<i>♪ Raise 'em up together ♪</i>

502
00:29:02,701 --> 00:29:03,827
<i>♪ Oh, my Lord ♪</i>

503
00:29:03,994 --> 00:29:04,995
Hold up.

504
00:29:05,829 --> 00:29:06,955
Slow down, Stack. Slow down.

505
00:29:07,122 --> 00:29:09,625
<i>♪ Rally can't hold me ♪</i>

506
00:29:10,959 --> 00:29:13,128
<i>♪ Rally can't hold me ♪</i>

507
00:29:13,962 --> 00:29:14,963
<i>♪ Rally can't hold me ♪</i>

508
00:29:15,130 --> 00:29:17,382
Y'all hold your heads
now, you hear me?

509
00:29:17,549 --> 00:29:19,176
-Hold your heads!
<i>-♪ Oh, my Lord ♪</i>

510
00:29:19,259 --> 00:29:20,636
Slim!

511
00:29:25,307 --> 00:29:26,600
Hey, you knew some of them?

512
00:29:29,645 --> 00:29:30,646
All of 'em.

513
00:29:32,606 --> 00:29:34,107
What happened?

514
00:29:39,238 --> 00:29:40,739
Me and my buddy Rice...

515
00:29:42,533 --> 00:29:44,618
we was hustlin' back
and forth up the Delta.

516
00:29:45,118 --> 00:29:46,703
We get busted for vagrancy.

517
00:29:47,538 --> 00:29:49,998
Them white sheriffs take
us down to the jailhouse

518
00:29:50,165 --> 00:29:51,166
and it's empty.

519
00:29:52,918 --> 00:29:54,718
Thought for sure they
gon' kill us that night.

520
00:29:56,922 --> 00:29:58,007
They give us our
instruments back,

521
00:29:58,090 --> 00:29:59,299
they tell us to play.

522
00:29:59,466 --> 00:30:00,634
Stack, we played,

523
00:30:00,801 --> 00:30:02,302
Preacherboy, we
played, you hear me?

524
00:30:03,136 --> 00:30:04,763
Music was comin'
out the windows.

525
00:30:05,264 --> 00:30:07,683
Peoples on the street were
stoppin' to come on in.

526
00:30:09,768 --> 00:30:10,853
Next day, one of them sheriffs,

527
00:30:10,936 --> 00:30:11,937
they get the bright idea

528
00:30:12,145 --> 00:30:13,545
they gonna take us
on the road now.

529
00:30:14,439 --> 00:30:16,119
They cover us, throw
us in the paddy wagon.

530
00:30:17,651 --> 00:30:19,403
They took us to this big house.

531
00:30:19,570 --> 00:30:22,739
I mean, it's full
of white folks.

532
00:30:22,906 --> 00:30:25,158
Pass around their hat
and have us to play.

533
00:30:25,576 --> 00:30:27,256
See, these white folks
we were playing for,

534
00:30:27,786 --> 00:30:28,954
they had real money.

535
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,707
Had y'all playing them
old ragtime songs?

536
00:30:31,874 --> 00:30:33,208
I sure was.

537
00:30:33,917 --> 00:30:35,961
We play a fair
amount of blues, too.

538
00:30:36,378 --> 00:30:38,338
See, white folks, they
like the blues just fine.

539
00:30:38,505 --> 00:30:40,257
They just don't like
the people who make it.

540
00:30:41,842 --> 00:30:43,468
Them peckerwoods was
noddin' their heads,

541
00:30:43,635 --> 00:30:44,636
stompin' their feet.

542
00:30:45,387 --> 00:30:47,931
Some of 'em was almost
on the rhythm, Stack.

543
00:30:49,349 --> 00:30:51,393
And then Rice and me, we
changed it up, confuse 'em.

544
00:30:54,271 --> 00:30:55,606
What did y'all do
with the money?

545
00:30:57,399 --> 00:30:58,400
I drank it.

546
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:02,279
Rice said he was gonna
take that money...

547
00:31:02,529 --> 00:31:04,615
go on out to Little Rock,
start him a little church.

548
00:31:04,781 --> 00:31:05,782
Did he?

549
00:31:08,118 --> 00:31:09,870
The damn fool.

550
00:31:10,787 --> 00:31:12,789
He took out all his money to pay

551
00:31:14,124 --> 00:31:15,542
for the $2 train ticket.

552
00:31:15,709 --> 00:31:16,749
Train conductor saw him...

553
00:31:16,877 --> 00:31:18,045
<i>That Black sumbitch
right there.</i>

554
00:31:18,128 --> 00:31:19,922
-...Klan got ahold to him.
<i>-Pull him over here!</i>

555
00:31:20,005 --> 00:31:22,007
Searched his pockets,
found all that money.

556
00:31:22,216 --> 00:31:24,009
Made up a story about him...

557
00:31:24,218 --> 00:31:25,378
killin' some white man for it

558
00:31:25,469 --> 00:31:26,637
and rapin' that
white man's wife.

559
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,055
<i>That boy's a murderer.</i>

560
00:31:28,222 --> 00:31:29,223
And they lynched him

561
00:31:29,389 --> 00:31:30,829
right there in the
railroad station.

562
00:31:31,058 --> 00:31:32,059
<i>No!</i>

563
00:31:35,354 --> 00:31:37,147
And you know, they
cut off his manhood.

564
00:31:55,123 --> 00:31:56,883
Got that guitar in your
hand, don't you, boy?

565
00:31:57,835 --> 00:32:00,379
Hey. Yeah, come on now.

566
00:32:01,129 --> 00:32:02,172
Hey!

567
00:32:22,693 --> 00:32:23,944
Hey, Cornbread!

568
00:32:26,071 --> 00:32:27,281
Ooh.

569
00:32:27,447 --> 00:32:30,075
Stack? Boy, long time no see.

570
00:32:30,826 --> 00:32:32,536
This here my wife, Therise.

571
00:32:33,245 --> 00:32:34,913
Nice to meet you, Therise.

572
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:36,206
Likewise.

573
00:32:36,373 --> 00:32:39,459
Need you to give us a moment.
Men got business to discuss.

574
00:32:39,626 --> 00:32:42,546
No, uh-uh. I ain't got time
for your schemin', Stack.

575
00:32:42,713 --> 00:32:44,006
Behind on my quota.

576
00:32:44,464 --> 00:32:45,716
Man, fuck your quota.

577
00:32:47,134 --> 00:32:48,719
This my wife right here, now.

578
00:32:48,886 --> 00:32:50,345
I'mma need you to
show some respect.

579
00:32:50,512 --> 00:32:52,097
Yeah, well, fuck your wife, too.

580
00:32:55,392 --> 00:32:56,393
What's that?

581
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:57,812
I said she really
gonna let you fuck her

582
00:32:57,895 --> 00:32:59,188
when she find out how much money

583
00:32:59,354 --> 00:33:01,023
you about to get from
this job I'm offering.

584
00:33:01,106 --> 00:33:02,506
And none of that
nice-and-slow shit

585
00:33:02,608 --> 00:33:03,775
she probably giving you now.

586
00:33:03,942 --> 00:33:06,223
Shit, she might even let you
put your pecker in her mouth.

587
00:33:09,323 --> 00:33:10,574
Boy, you shoulda stayed gone,

588
00:33:10,741 --> 00:33:12,493
'cause I'm about to beat
the black off of you.

589
00:33:12,576 --> 00:33:14,776
-Come on now!
-I don't want no trouble! Hey!

590
00:33:15,370 --> 00:33:17,497
Well, how much money you
talkin' about payin' him?

591
00:33:19,458 --> 00:33:21,043
Oh, that's a good woman.

592
00:33:21,710 --> 00:33:22,794
Come on.

593
00:33:22,961 --> 00:33:24,046
We be back.

594
00:34:15,138 --> 00:34:16,473
Papa's here.

595
00:34:18,391 --> 00:34:20,060
Yeah. Papa's here.

596
00:34:39,204 --> 00:34:40,789
How you be?

597
00:34:41,665 --> 00:34:43,958
No miseries worth
complaining about.

598
00:34:50,132 --> 00:34:51,341
You come alone?

599
00:34:55,846 --> 00:34:57,764
Yeah. Stack on the
other side of town.

600
00:35:00,601 --> 00:35:01,602
What you come back for?

601
00:35:05,189 --> 00:35:06,732
We bought that old saw mill.

602
00:35:07,065 --> 00:35:11,028
Yeah, we gon' patch it up,
make it into a juke joint.

603
00:35:11,195 --> 00:35:12,613
A juke joint.

604
00:35:14,573 --> 00:35:16,200
This one of Stack's ideas?

605
00:35:16,366 --> 00:35:18,535
Yeah, he figure tonight
gonna be a grand opening.

606
00:35:18,702 --> 00:35:20,537
I thought y'all was
done with the Delta.

607
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:22,915
Last I heard, y'all
were northern men.

608
00:35:23,081 --> 00:35:24,958
Nah, we through with Chicago.

609
00:35:25,125 --> 00:35:26,627
Chicago through with y'all?

610
00:35:27,794 --> 00:35:29,171
What you asking?

611
00:35:29,338 --> 00:35:30,881
Who you and Stack robbed

612
00:35:31,048 --> 00:35:32,841
to get enough money
for them crackers

613
00:35:33,008 --> 00:35:34,301
to sell you a whole mill?

614
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,319
Just this, Miss Annie.

615
00:35:52,945 --> 00:35:54,655
And a pinch of High John.

616
00:35:54,821 --> 00:35:55,948
All right.

617
00:35:56,114 --> 00:35:59,159
Now, don't sell none of
this on the way home.

618
00:35:59,701 --> 00:36:01,745
I don't want your mama
comin' at me crazy later.

619
00:36:01,912 --> 00:36:03,121
Yes, ma'am.

620
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:04,581
Thank you.

621
00:36:08,168 --> 00:36:10,379
I can't believe you taking
this make-believe shit.

622
00:36:10,546 --> 00:36:12,840
Smoke, give me my money
'fore I cut your Black ass.

623
00:36:13,006 --> 00:36:14,591
You can put that
blade up, woman.

624
00:36:16,844 --> 00:36:18,637
-I'll trade ya.
-I don't want your money.

625
00:36:18,804 --> 00:36:20,556
-Don't be stupid, now.
-I ain't stupid.

626
00:36:20,722 --> 00:36:21,802
Your money come with blood.

627
00:36:21,890 --> 00:36:23,170
All money come with blood, baby.

628
00:36:23,308 --> 00:36:24,351
Not like yours.

629
00:36:24,518 --> 00:36:25,853
This shit won't even
spend nowhere else.

630
00:36:25,936 --> 00:36:27,438
-Look at it.
-I ain't goin' nowhere else.

631
00:36:27,521 --> 00:36:29,648
I don't need that
cursed money you got.

632
00:36:35,153 --> 00:36:36,873
You know, woman, I been
all over this world.

633
00:36:37,489 --> 00:36:42,661
In cars. Ships. Trains.

634
00:36:45,289 --> 00:36:48,709
I seen men die ways I didn't
even know was possible.

635
00:36:50,085 --> 00:36:53,797
I ain't never saw no
roots, no demons...

636
00:36:54,214 --> 00:36:56,967
no ghosts, no magic.

637
00:36:58,719 --> 00:37:00,679
Just power.

638
00:37:01,138 --> 00:37:04,474
And only money can get you that.

639
00:37:05,475 --> 00:37:06,518
You fool.

640
00:37:07,436 --> 00:37:08,729
All that war.

641
00:37:08,896 --> 00:37:11,565
Or whatever the hell else
you been doin' in Chicago.

642
00:37:12,691 --> 00:37:14,651
And you back here
in front of me.

643
00:37:15,402 --> 00:37:18,947
Two arms, two legs, two
eyes, and a brain that work.

644
00:37:19,573 --> 00:37:21,658
How you know I ain't pray...

645
00:37:22,201 --> 00:37:24,494
and work every root
my grandmama taught me

646
00:37:24,661 --> 00:37:27,164
to keep you and that crazy
brother of yours safe

647
00:37:27,331 --> 00:37:29,166
every day since you been gone?

648
00:37:33,504 --> 00:37:35,964
So why those roots ain't
work on our baby, then?

649
00:37:40,677 --> 00:37:41,678
I don't know.

650
00:37:45,057 --> 00:37:46,225
But they work for you.

651
00:37:57,152 --> 00:37:59,071
You still got that mojo bag.

652
00:38:33,146 --> 00:38:34,481
Soil of my soil...

653
00:38:35,315 --> 00:38:37,734
bone of my bone,
blood of my blood.

654
00:38:37,901 --> 00:38:38,902
I bless you.

655
00:38:40,279 --> 00:38:41,280
Ashe.

656
00:38:58,380 --> 00:39:00,007
Why you here, Smoke?

657
00:39:01,383 --> 00:39:03,051
What you want with me?

658
00:39:05,554 --> 00:39:07,806
We was hopin' to serve
food at the juke tonight.

659
00:39:10,184 --> 00:39:11,602
We want you to cook for us.

660
00:39:13,478 --> 00:39:14,563
Elijah.

661
00:39:20,110 --> 00:39:21,695
You gonna make me say it?

662
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:27,075
It still hurts coming back here.

663
00:39:30,579 --> 00:39:31,580
But I love ya.

664
00:39:34,625 --> 00:39:35,709
And I miss ya.

665
00:41:49,968 --> 00:41:51,094
Help!

666
00:41:51,261 --> 00:41:52,429
Back up.

667
00:41:52,596 --> 00:41:54,056
Y'all gotta help.

668
00:41:54,681 --> 00:41:57,142
I thought I could trust them,
but they tried to kill me.

669
00:41:57,309 --> 00:41:58,853
-Slow down.
-Who's tryin' to kill you?

670
00:41:58,936 --> 00:41:59,978
Choctaw.

671
00:42:00,145 --> 00:42:01,897
Sure it wasn't just some
fair-skinned niggers?

672
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:03,857
Ain't no Injuns
around here for miles.

673
00:42:05,609 --> 00:42:06,860
Oh, God.

674
00:42:10,197 --> 00:42:13,992
They took my wife. Oh, God.

675
00:42:15,035 --> 00:42:16,703
I'm a coward, ain't I?

676
00:42:24,711 --> 00:42:25,712
I got gold.

677
00:42:26,630 --> 00:42:28,924
Them dirty Injuns
meant to rob me.

678
00:42:29,091 --> 00:42:31,760
They ain't get all of
it. Y'all can have it.

679
00:42:31,927 --> 00:42:33,595
Just don't let 'em
hurt me no more.

680
00:43:00,372 --> 00:43:01,373
Evening, ma'am.

681
00:43:03,083 --> 00:43:06,712
We're in pursuit of
someone very dangerous.

682
00:43:07,254 --> 00:43:09,006
He might've come
onto your property.

683
00:43:09,423 --> 00:43:11,300
Have you seen anyone recently?

684
00:43:11,925 --> 00:43:12,926
No.

685
00:43:14,803 --> 00:43:15,804
Bert!

686
00:43:16,388 --> 00:43:18,140
Is he in there with you, ma'am?

687
00:43:21,602 --> 00:43:22,811
He's not what he seems.

688
00:43:24,271 --> 00:43:26,398
God forbid you let
him into your home.

689
00:43:26,565 --> 00:43:29,776
And if so, we need to act now.

690
00:43:58,305 --> 00:43:59,306
Bert.

691
00:44:00,766 --> 00:44:02,309
Injuns came and went.

692
00:44:04,144 --> 00:44:05,144
Bert?

693
00:44:14,988 --> 00:44:15,988
Bert?

694
00:44:23,330 --> 00:44:24,456
Bert?

695
00:44:28,335 --> 00:44:30,212
Oh, he's just resting.

696
00:44:42,015 --> 00:44:43,517
He's all better now.

697
00:44:44,351 --> 00:44:45,644
Hey, baby.

698
00:44:48,605 --> 00:44:49,731
Don't cry.

699
00:44:59,658 --> 00:45:00,784
Don't fall now.

700
00:45:02,828 --> 00:45:03,912
To the right.

701
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:05,122
A little more.

702
00:45:06,248 --> 00:45:07,328
Oh, shit.

703
00:45:11,670 --> 00:45:13,547
Right this way. Ladies.

704
00:45:14,256 --> 00:45:16,633
Come on in! Welcome
to Club Juke.

705
00:45:17,050 --> 00:45:18,970
We about to get it poppin'
like fish grease, boy.

706
00:45:29,313 --> 00:45:32,649
We got whiskey, Irish
beer, Italian wine.

707
00:45:32,816 --> 00:45:34,276
Y'all some classy
niggas, ain't you?

708
00:45:34,818 --> 00:45:36,320
Too fancy for me.

709
00:45:36,778 --> 00:45:38,363
Ma'am, I don't need
no ice or nothin'.

710
00:45:38,989 --> 00:45:39,990
Corn liquor'll do.

711
00:45:40,157 --> 00:45:41,491
That'll be 50 cent.

712
00:45:42,075 --> 00:45:43,535
God damn, I just got 30.

713
00:45:43,702 --> 00:45:45,742
But these is good down at
the Maybell general store.

714
00:45:49,166 --> 00:45:51,001
-You like that cold, right?
-I certainly do.

715
00:45:51,084 --> 00:45:52,503
Comin' right up.

716
00:45:53,170 --> 00:45:54,505
I thank you kindly.

717
00:45:55,088 --> 00:45:56,632
Let me holla at
y'all right quick.

718
00:45:58,300 --> 00:46:00,844
-Good evenin'.
-Evenin'.

719
00:46:01,011 --> 00:46:02,331
You look mighty nice.

720
00:46:02,471 --> 00:46:03,680
Thank you.

721
00:46:03,847 --> 00:46:04,932
You made it.

722
00:46:09,728 --> 00:46:11,271
This ain't no house party.

723
00:46:11,438 --> 00:46:13,190
And it damn sure
ain't no charity.

724
00:46:13,357 --> 00:46:16,068
We takin' cash, U.S.
motherfuckin' dollars.

725
00:46:16,235 --> 00:46:17,486
This ain't Chicago, Smoke.

726
00:46:17,861 --> 00:46:18,862
The fuck that mean?

727
00:46:19,029 --> 00:46:20,281
That old nigga
worked his ass off

728
00:46:20,364 --> 00:46:21,448
for them wooden nickels.

729
00:46:21,865 --> 00:46:24,159
<i>See, these niggas been
workin' in the field all day.</i>

730
00:46:24,326 --> 00:46:26,662
<i>When they show up here,
let them enjoy themselves.</i>

731
00:46:26,828 --> 00:46:29,165
<i>They gotta feel wanted if
you want this here to work.</i>

732
00:46:29,248 --> 00:46:31,333
<i>This place supposed to
feel like it's for them.</i>

733
00:46:31,416 --> 00:46:32,417
Right this way.

734
00:46:33,252 --> 00:46:34,253
Uh-huh.

735
00:46:35,128 --> 00:46:36,129
Uh...

736
00:46:36,755 --> 00:46:38,131
Excuse me, ma'am.

737
00:46:38,757 --> 00:46:40,175
You sure you at the right place?

738
00:46:40,342 --> 00:46:42,678
That's a damn good
question, Cornbread.

739
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:44,721
Little Mary?

740
00:46:45,264 --> 00:46:46,598
Not so little no more, huh?

741
00:46:46,765 --> 00:46:48,684
Little Mary. Aw.

742
00:46:49,226 --> 00:46:50,978
When they turn this
place into a juke?

743
00:46:51,061 --> 00:46:52,855
We did it today.
My cousins own it.

744
00:46:53,021 --> 00:46:54,273
You know the Twins.

745
00:46:55,232 --> 00:46:56,900
Heard of 'em, of course.

746
00:46:57,067 --> 00:46:58,402
They your cousins?

747
00:46:58,986 --> 00:47:00,863
Y'all must be play cousins.

748
00:47:01,029 --> 00:47:02,865
Their daddy was my
daddy big brother.

749
00:47:03,782 --> 00:47:05,284
So y'all cousins through blood?

750
00:47:06,368 --> 00:47:08,787
But you seem like
such a nice young man.

751
00:47:09,246 --> 00:47:10,539
I ain't always nice.

752
00:47:11,456 --> 00:47:12,791
Ain't that young, either.

753
00:47:18,338 --> 00:47:21,008
My condolences
about your mother.

754
00:47:21,550 --> 00:47:23,468
We'd have made the repast...

755
00:47:24,386 --> 00:47:26,013
but me and Therise had to work.

756
00:47:26,180 --> 00:47:27,472
It's all right.

757
00:47:29,641 --> 00:47:30,810
Now let me get on in
here and get a drink

758
00:47:30,893 --> 00:47:31,933
before I start tearing up.

759
00:47:32,060 --> 00:47:33,562
Go on. Enjoy yourself.

760
00:47:37,191 --> 00:47:39,067
-You got my $2?
-Huh?

761
00:47:40,861 --> 00:47:42,363
When you was sellin' ass
out in Little Rock...

762
00:47:42,446 --> 00:47:44,573
you ever let a john pay with
a goddamn promissory note?

763
00:47:44,656 --> 00:47:45,699
Hell no.

764
00:47:47,576 --> 00:47:50,621
But, see, I wasn't
sellin' ass in the Delta.

765
00:47:50,787 --> 00:47:51,997
You gon' play?

766
00:47:52,164 --> 00:47:53,290
You gon' sing?

767
00:47:54,917 --> 00:47:56,668
We'll see where
the night takes us.

768
00:47:58,921 --> 00:48:00,255
Your husband coming?

769
00:48:05,677 --> 00:48:06,678
Shit.

770
00:48:06,845 --> 00:48:07,846
Hold on.

771
00:48:10,432 --> 00:48:11,725
Excuse me, ma'am.

772
00:48:12,476 --> 00:48:13,602
I don't think you
should be here.

773
00:48:13,685 --> 00:48:15,020
You see, I'm with the Twins...

774
00:48:15,187 --> 00:48:16,230
With the Twins?

775
00:48:16,813 --> 00:48:18,524
Boy, if you don't get
the fuck out my face...

776
00:48:18,607 --> 00:48:19,847
I am with them, ma'am.

777
00:48:19,942 --> 00:48:21,693
We met earlier at
the train station.

778
00:48:21,860 --> 00:48:22,861
I'm their lil' cousin.

779
00:48:23,779 --> 00:48:24,780
Little cousin?

780
00:48:24,947 --> 00:48:26,823
I think you should leave
before they see you.

781
00:48:27,241 --> 00:48:28,742
Wait, you not little Sammie?

782
00:48:29,660 --> 00:48:30,911
The guitar.

783
00:48:32,079 --> 00:48:33,580
You old enough to drink now?

784
00:48:34,498 --> 00:48:35,999
Come on, let me buy you a drink.

785
00:48:38,710 --> 00:48:39,962
-Hey, Mary.
-Grace.

786
00:48:40,128 --> 00:48:41,129
Good to see ya.

787
00:48:41,296 --> 00:48:43,048
-Two whiskeys, please.
-Sure.

788
00:48:43,215 --> 00:48:44,383
I don't know hoodoo,

789
00:48:44,550 --> 00:48:46,760
and I can't talk slick,
but I know business.

790
00:48:47,094 --> 00:48:49,429
And this is bad for business.

791
00:48:49,596 --> 00:48:50,681
It's opening night.

792
00:48:50,848 --> 00:48:52,975
Besides, only be a
few of 'em like this.

793
00:48:56,186 --> 00:48:58,397
I need a goddamn cigarette.

794
00:48:58,605 --> 00:48:59,606
Comin' right up.

795
00:49:00,315 --> 00:49:01,835
So you play that
guitar they left you?

796
00:49:03,026 --> 00:49:04,444
-Yeah.
-That's good.

797
00:49:04,820 --> 00:49:06,488
You makin' any money
with that thing?

798
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:11,201
Not really. Not yet, at least.

799
00:49:12,369 --> 00:49:14,121
I'd tell ya it didn't matter
as long as you love it,

800
00:49:14,204 --> 00:49:15,831
but that'd be horseshit advice.

801
00:49:20,586 --> 00:49:21,587
Hey, what are you?

802
00:49:23,922 --> 00:49:24,923
What am I?

803
00:49:26,216 --> 00:49:27,551
I'm a human being.

804
00:49:28,510 --> 00:49:30,762
Oh. That ain't what I
meant. I meant, more like...

805
00:49:30,929 --> 00:49:32,055
I know what you meant.

806
00:49:34,558 --> 00:49:36,310
My mama's daddy was half Black.

807
00:49:37,769 --> 00:49:40,147
He raised her to keep the
Klan from killing her.

808
00:49:41,356 --> 00:49:43,317
You know my mama
delivered the Twins?

809
00:49:44,318 --> 00:49:45,319
Really?

810
00:49:45,485 --> 00:49:46,565
She saved Stack life

811
00:49:46,653 --> 00:49:47,905
after he got stuck
in their mama.

812
00:49:47,988 --> 00:49:48,989
And after she died,

813
00:49:49,156 --> 00:49:50,796
my mama nursed them
like they was her own.

814
00:49:56,496 --> 00:49:59,917
And they had enough money
to buy this whole mill...

815
00:50:00,083 --> 00:50:02,586
and they ain't even send
flowers to her funeral.

816
00:50:02,753 --> 00:50:06,632
We sent your mama
flowers. Plenty of 'em.

817
00:50:07,424 --> 00:50:09,426
All while she still
alive to smell 'em.

818
00:50:11,053 --> 00:50:12,721
-Smoke.
-Mary.

819
00:50:14,181 --> 00:50:15,541
Why don't you go
check in on Slim?

820
00:50:15,807 --> 00:50:17,059
See if he'll need backup.

821
00:50:35,494 --> 00:50:36,574
Take care of her or I will.

822
00:50:36,662 --> 00:50:38,497
No, no, I'mma
handle it. I got it.

823
00:50:38,664 --> 00:50:39,904
-All right, go on.
-I'm goin'.

824
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:43,961
Come on. Let's go.

825
00:50:44,127 --> 00:50:46,255
-I'm not here for you.
-Then why you here, then?

826
00:50:48,257 --> 00:50:49,716
I come to hear the blues.

827
00:50:49,883 --> 00:50:51,260
Oh, no, they play the blues
just fine in Arkansas.

828
00:50:51,343 --> 00:50:52,386
Come on.

829
00:50:52,511 --> 00:50:53,637
Cornbread, let's get her a car.

830
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:54,721
Get your hands off me.

831
00:50:56,181 --> 00:50:57,182
What's it gon' take?

832
00:50:57,850 --> 00:51:00,143
Hm? How much to get
you to get the fuck on?

833
00:51:00,310 --> 00:51:01,562
You can't pay me off.

834
00:51:02,229 --> 00:51:04,148
Fine. I'll pay one of these
field bitches in here...

835
00:51:04,231 --> 00:51:05,311
to drag your ass out, then.

836
00:51:05,399 --> 00:51:06,984
Shit. You taught
me how to fight.

837
00:51:07,150 --> 00:51:08,778
I'll beat up every bitch
in here and you know it.

838
00:51:08,861 --> 00:51:11,061
I taught you how to walk away
when the money is up, too.

839
00:51:12,030 --> 00:51:13,190
Got you a rich white husband.

840
00:51:13,323 --> 00:51:14,783
Got you a farm.
Now go home to it.

841
00:51:14,950 --> 00:51:16,410
I ain't ask for none of that.

842
00:51:17,536 --> 00:51:19,913
All that shit was your idea.
I didn't want no white man.

843
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:22,165
I didn't wanna be white.
I wanted to be with you.

844
00:51:22,332 --> 00:51:24,543
All it'd take is the wrong
person in here to see you...

845
00:51:24,710 --> 00:51:26,796
word get back to them crackers
and they gon' try to kill you.

846
00:51:26,879 --> 00:51:27,921
Would it matter to you?

847
00:51:29,506 --> 00:51:31,626
'Cause if somebody out there
put their hands on you...

848
00:51:32,134 --> 00:51:33,260
if they hurt you...

849
00:51:33,969 --> 00:51:35,569
me and my brother gon'
come kill 'em all.

850
00:51:35,846 --> 00:51:37,139
So you'll kill for me.

851
00:51:37,681 --> 00:51:38,682
That's right.

852
00:51:40,350 --> 00:51:42,352
But you still won't
tell me the truth.

853
00:51:43,478 --> 00:51:45,689
I was young enough to
believe you were comin' back.

854
00:51:47,774 --> 00:51:51,236
I waited. I waited a long time.

855
00:51:53,655 --> 00:51:55,574
But I'm grown now, Stack.

856
00:51:56,491 --> 00:51:58,160
And I know you never
planned to stay.

857
00:52:00,204 --> 00:52:01,705
Why can't you just say that?

858
00:52:01,872 --> 00:52:03,165
Say what?

859
00:52:04,374 --> 00:52:05,459
Hm?

860
00:52:10,214 --> 00:52:11,673
That I love you?

861
00:52:16,637 --> 00:52:18,305
That I think about
you every day?

862
00:52:21,850 --> 00:52:23,852
I just wanted to keep
you someplace safe.

863
00:52:25,979 --> 00:52:27,648
And that was never gon' be here.

864
00:52:30,359 --> 00:52:32,069
And that was never
gon' be with me.

865
00:52:34,029 --> 00:52:35,197
Never.

866
00:52:36,448 --> 00:52:37,491
All right.

867
00:53:21,076 --> 00:53:22,077
Yeah.

868
00:53:22,661 --> 00:53:23,662
Hey...

869
00:53:26,248 --> 00:53:30,878
I been hearin' about this one
particular young man all day.

870
00:53:31,712 --> 00:53:34,381
He 'posed to be a bad blues man.

871
00:53:36,550 --> 00:53:38,260
Preacherboy, where you at?

872
00:53:38,427 --> 00:53:39,636
Come on here, now.

873
00:53:47,728 --> 00:53:50,189
That's my little cousin,
y'all. Watch this.

874
00:53:53,817 --> 00:53:55,377
Hold up, hold up.

875
00:53:56,028 --> 00:53:58,864
Tell 'em who you
are, where you from.

876
00:54:03,994 --> 00:54:05,370
I'm Sammie Moore.

877
00:54:05,537 --> 00:54:08,081
-All right.
-Come on, now.

878
00:54:08,498 --> 00:54:12,211
I'm a sharecropper from
Sunflower plantation.

879
00:54:14,963 --> 00:54:16,256
They call me Preacherboy

880
00:54:16,423 --> 00:54:17,823
account of my daddy
being a pastor.

881
00:54:18,217 --> 00:54:20,057
-All right, now.
-Amen.

882
00:54:20,469 --> 00:54:21,845
I wrote this song for him.

883
00:54:22,012 --> 00:54:23,092

00:59:47,045 --> 00:59:48,547
Keep your foot on it, at least.

948
00:59:56,471 --> 00:59:59,266
Hold on. I wanna try something.

949
01:00:01,018 --> 01:00:02,144
Wait.

950
01:00:02,519 --> 01:00:03,979
Preacherboy...

951
01:00:04,521 --> 01:00:07,524
let me wash up
first. I walked here.

952
01:00:09,193 --> 01:00:10,194
You're beautiful.

953
01:00:11,778 --> 01:00:13,030
I just wanna taste you.

954
01:00:26,543 --> 01:00:28,128
Shit.

955
01:00:34,968 --> 01:00:36,637
Excuse me. How y'all doin'?

956
01:00:36,803 --> 01:00:39,765
Good? Havin' another
drink? All right now.

957
01:00:42,226 --> 01:00:44,269
Shit.

958
01:00:46,522 --> 01:00:47,523
Hey.

959
01:00:47,689 --> 01:00:49,024
Preacherboy.

960
01:00:53,153 --> 01:00:54,613
Boy found that
button, didn't he?

961
01:00:54,780 --> 01:00:56,657
Hey. Smoke wants ya.

962
01:00:56,823 --> 01:00:58,242
Check out my little cousin.

963
01:01:04,748 --> 01:01:07,251
He call himself, tellin'
me about the cotton.

964
01:01:07,417 --> 01:01:11,171
I said, "Shit... that boy
don't know nothin'..."

965
01:01:16,718 --> 01:01:20,264
Get the Twins. Go on. Get 'em.

966
01:01:20,639 --> 01:01:22,057
I tallied the till.

967
01:01:24,059 --> 01:01:26,520
And? What's the count?

968
01:01:29,314 --> 01:01:32,526
Now, that top figure,
that's plantation money.

969
01:01:33,735 --> 01:01:36,738
That bottom figure,
that's real dollars.

970
01:01:39,074 --> 01:01:40,242
So what's the projection?

971
01:01:40,409 --> 01:01:42,828
Two months, and we
out of fresh cash.

972
01:01:44,329 --> 01:01:46,039
-Hey there.
-Good evening.

973
01:01:46,540 --> 01:01:47,833
How may I help you folks?

974
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,210
Oh, we heard tell of a party.

975
01:01:50,711 --> 01:01:53,463
Drink, food, blues
music and the like.

976
01:01:54,047 --> 01:01:55,048
You did?

977
01:01:55,924 --> 01:01:56,925
We like to drink.

978
01:01:57,551 --> 01:02:00,512
We happen to be musicians,
and we walked here.

979
01:02:00,679 --> 01:02:03,265
So, we hungry as dogs.

980
01:02:03,432 --> 01:02:05,267
Woof woof.

981
01:02:06,310 --> 01:02:08,353
You wouldn't mind us
comin' in, now, would you?

982
01:02:09,646 --> 01:02:11,406

the wrong place.

983
01:02:11,899 --> 01:02:13,984
What makes ya say that?

984
01:02:21,074 --> 01:02:22,535
You fellers must be the owners

985
01:02:22,618 --> 01:02:23,785
of this establishment.

986
01:02:23,952 --> 01:02:25,787
That's right. And you are?

987
01:02:25,954 --> 01:02:29,124
Name's Remmick. This
here's Joan and Bert.

988
01:02:29,750 --> 01:02:31,085
Hey, Stack, y'all all right?

01:02:31,168 --> 01:02:33,462

990
01:02:34,588 --> 01:02:36,840

heard from out here.

991
01:02:38,634 --> 01:02:39,801
It was beautiful.

992
01:02:39,968 --> 01:02:41,553
Goddamn beautiful voice.

993
01:02:41,720 --> 01:02:43,305
Even through these walls.

994
01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:45,682
Mm.

995
01:02:46,683 --> 01:02:47,851
Where y'all from?

996
01:02:48,018 --> 01:02:49,144
Just down the road.

997
01:02:49,311 --> 01:02:50,437
And how far is that?

998
01:02:50,604 --> 01:02:51,605
North Carolina.

999
01:02:51,772 --> 01:02:53,899
-Y'all Klan?
-Sir...

01:02:56,109 --> 01:02:58,111

1027

Plenty of white
barrelhouses down there.

1028
01:04:05,470 --> 01:04:07,306

You don't need to do that, sir.

1036
01:04:27,951 --> 01:04:29,369
We'll be on our way.

1037
01:04:32,664 --> 01:04:34,458
But we're gonna walk real slow.

1038
01:04:35,334 --> 01:04:37,127

Y'all have a nice night.

1040
01:04:50,224 --> 01:04:51,517

You think they brought company?

1044
01:04:57,231 --> 01:04:58,273
I doubt it.

1045
01:04:58,440 --> 01:05:00,400
But we got enough pepper
on us if they did.

1046
01:05:00,567 --> 01:05:02,236
Shit, we forgot the trunk.

1047
01:05:02,402 --> 01:05:03,487
Man, why ain't you remind me?

1048
01:05:03,570 --> 01:05:05,405
Fool, I told you to remind me.

1049
01:05:05,572 --> 01:05:08,575
Y'all don't need the trunk.
There was just three of 'em.

1050
01:05:09,368 --> 01:05:10,702
Now listen to me,

1051
01:05:10,869 --> 01:05:12,704
what if they just came to sing?

1052
01:05:12,871 --> 01:05:14,790
And what if somebody
spill somethin' on 'em?

1053
01:05:14,957 --> 01:05:16,208
Step on their shoe?

1054
01:05:16,375 --> 01:05:17,876

1055
01:05:18,043 --> 01:05:20,462

Don't let them in.

1058
01:05:46,446 --> 01:05:47,573
They said you wanna talk.

1059
01:05:47,739 --> 01:05:48,740
Yeah.

1060
01:05:48,907 --> 01:05:50,227

Can't thank you enough for this.

1063
01:05:56,582 --> 01:05:58,702
I mean, y'all the ones who

1064
01:05:59,209 --> 01:06:00,210

Well, you got the talent.
That's for certain.

1066
01:06:03,755 --> 01:06:06,091
But all this ain't
no life for nobody.

1067
01:06:06,717 --> 01:06:09,761
I know plenty musicians. I
ain't never met a happy one.

1068
01:06:10,095 --> 01:06:11,763
Yeah, it's cute now.

1069
01:06:12,097 --> 01:06:15,309
But it get old. That ramblin'.

1070
01:06:15,851 --> 01:06:17,171
I mean, being with
y'all today...

1071
01:06:19,730 --> 01:06:21,315
Smoke, I feel like I'm flying.

1072
01:06:22,316 --> 01:06:23,650
Well, today settled it.

1073
01:06:24,234 --> 01:06:25,819
I'm headin' off on my own.

1074
01:06:26,361 --> 01:06:27,362
Where you goin'?

1075
01:06:27,821 --> 01:06:28,822
I don't know.

1076
01:06:30,657 --> 01:06:32,826
-Maybe Chicago.
-Hm.

1077
01:06:33,118 --> 01:06:34,198
What's wrong, Stack?

1078
01:06:34,286 --> 01:06:35,329
We underwater.

1079
01:06:35,495 --> 01:06:36,496
How?

1080
01:06:37,539 --> 01:06:39,958
All the plantations down
there payin' with credits.

1081
01:06:42,336 --> 01:06:43,462
What about them crackers?

1082
01:06:43,629 --> 01:06:44,630
What about 'em?

1083
01:06:44,796 --> 01:06:46,882
I can go feel 'em out
before they're too far gone.

1084
01:06:47,049 --> 01:06:48,800
I could feel 'em out myself.

1085
01:06:49,468 --> 01:06:51,678
They'll tell me more
than they'll tell you.

1086
01:06:51,845 --> 01:06:53,445
And I can find out
what they really have.

1087
01:06:53,555 --> 01:06:54,890
And what happens if
they're from Little Rock?

1088
01:06:54,973 --> 01:06:55,974
They ain't.

1089
01:06:56,141 --> 01:06:58,727
One day our daddy
beat Stack real bad.

1090
01:06:59,228 --> 01:07:01,605
So we get in our minds
that we need to run away.

1091
01:07:02,105 --> 01:07:04,399
See, me, I wanna go to
the next plantation over.

1092
01:07:04,608 --> 01:07:07,653
But Stack, he figure
we get to Mound Bayou.

1093
01:07:07,986 --> 01:07:10,155
Small town. Right
here in Mississippi.

1094
01:07:10,364 --> 01:07:12,074
Founded by free slaves.

1095
01:07:12,241 --> 01:07:14,785
And everything is Black-owned.

1096
01:07:15,244 --> 01:07:16,328
That sound like a crock.

1097
01:07:16,495 --> 01:07:17,746
Yeah, well, I seen it.

1098
01:07:18,413 --> 01:07:19,790
Why y'all ain't stay?

1099
01:07:19,957 --> 01:07:22,251
That mayor knew
who our daddy was.

1100
01:07:22,417 --> 01:07:24,253
Knew he was a evil man.

1101
01:07:24,461 --> 01:07:25,712
Figured it was no way

1102
01:07:25,879 --> 01:07:28,006
that he ain't passed
that evil down to us.

1103
01:07:28,841 --> 01:07:30,509
<i>Let me go get
this money for us.</i>

1104
01:07:30,843 --> 01:07:32,135
I know y'all need it.

1105
01:07:32,344 --> 01:07:33,664
And what's that
supposed to mean?

1106
01:07:33,971 --> 01:07:35,389
See, your daddy a preacher.

1107
01:07:35,806 --> 01:07:37,558
You can go and do that.

1108
01:07:37,724 --> 01:07:40,394
You like makin' music?
Make church music.

1109
01:07:40,519 --> 01:07:41,645
You wan' leave...

1110
01:07:42,229 --> 01:07:44,064
go on down Mound Bayou.

1111
01:07:44,231 --> 01:07:46,316
Live with the
proper Black folks.

1112
01:07:46,859 --> 01:07:49,736
Leave all this here
improper shit to us.

1113
01:07:49,903 --> 01:07:53,115
Irish beer? Italian wine?

1114
01:07:54,157 --> 01:07:55,242
You rob both sides.

1115
01:07:55,492 --> 01:07:56,493
Let 'em blame each other

1116
01:07:56,660 --> 01:07:57,745
while you and Smoke
come down here

1117
01:07:57,828 --> 01:07:58,954
and set up shop.

1118
01:07:59,454 --> 01:08:00,748
You gon' need every
dime you can get

1119
01:08:00,831 --> 01:08:02,082
when they put two
and two together.

1120
01:08:02,165 --> 01:08:03,208
But they won't.

1121
01:08:03,375 --> 01:08:04,418
They might.

1122
01:08:04,710 --> 01:08:06,110
Well, I ain't goin'
to Mound Bayou.

1123
01:08:06,253 --> 01:08:09,756
My daddy a reverend, but
I'm y'all cousin, too.

1124
01:08:09,923 --> 01:08:12,342
And a lot more people
know the Smokestack Twins

1125
01:08:12,509 --> 01:08:13,719
than they know my daddy.

1126
01:08:13,886 --> 01:08:14,887
Yeah?

1127
01:08:16,220 --> 01:08:17,847
Well, you better enjoy
the rest of the night,

1128
01:08:17,930 --> 01:08:19,515
'cause this your last juke.

1129
01:08:21,350 --> 01:08:22,435
You ain't in no position

1130
01:08:22,603 --> 01:08:23,843
to tell me how to live my life.

1131
01:08:23,979 --> 01:08:25,064
Let me go talk to them...

1132
01:08:25,147 --> 01:08:27,232
and see about puttin'
something real on the till.

1133
01:08:27,774 --> 01:08:28,774
Come on.

1134
01:08:39,828 --> 01:08:40,828
Come tomorrow,

1135
01:08:40,996 --> 01:08:42,836
I find out about you
playin' in one of these...

1136
01:08:43,497 --> 01:08:45,125
boy, I'll kill you myself.

1137
01:08:45,501 --> 01:08:46,709
Look, I'm leaving
that plantation

1138
01:08:46,792 --> 01:08:47,961
just like y'all did.

1139
01:08:48,629 --> 01:08:50,339
And if that's a
problem for you...

1140
01:08:50,796 --> 01:08:52,090
kill me now.

1141
01:08:59,264 --> 01:09:00,390
What's the matter?

1142
01:09:01,725 --> 01:09:03,018
I'm a soldier, boy.

1143
01:09:03,977 --> 01:09:05,979

I just come to see if
y'all was good people.

1165
01:11:06,558 --> 01:11:07,685
Aw, darlin', that's
so sweet of you.

1166
01:11:07,768 --> 01:11:10,312
-So sweet.
-We most surely are.

1167
01:11:10,479 --> 01:11:11,897
And y'all got money to spend?

1168
01:11:12,064 --> 01:11:15,359
Oh, yeah. Plenty
money. You wanna see?

1169
01:11:15,526 --> 01:11:16,735
Yeah, I wanna see.

1170
01:11:21,615 --> 01:11:22,866
What type of money is this?

1171
01:11:23,033 --> 01:11:25,160
The solid gold kind, darlin'.

1172
01:11:26,203 --> 01:11:27,204
Yeah.

1173
01:11:27,996 --> 01:11:29,081
Where's this from?

1174
01:11:29,456 --> 01:11:32,042
It's from a different
place and a different time.

1175
01:11:32,209 --> 01:11:33,544
But it spends just the same.

1176
01:11:34,753 --> 01:11:35,921
You can have it.

1177
01:11:37,673 --> 01:11:38,799
But it's no good to you.

1178
01:11:38,966 --> 01:11:40,759
-It's no good to her.
-Mm-mm.

1179
01:11:41,635 --> 01:11:43,178
Well, what makes you say that?

1180
01:11:43,971 --> 01:11:45,889
'Cause you in some
deep, deep pain

1181
01:11:46,056 --> 01:11:47,391
that money can't fix.

1182
01:11:48,892 --> 01:11:50,102
Am I right?

1183
01:11:51,353 --> 01:11:53,355
You came over here for
fellowship and love.

1184
01:11:53,772 --> 01:11:55,399
Fellowship and love.

1185
01:12:00,863 --> 01:12:02,072
My mother...

1186
01:12:05,284 --> 01:12:06,368
she just passed.

1187
01:12:06,535 --> 01:12:07,744
Oh, that's awful.

1188
01:12:08,829 --> 01:12:10,706
-Oh.
-Just awful.

1189
01:12:11,123 --> 01:12:12,124
Just awful.

1190
01:12:12,708 --> 01:12:14,251
Losing a mother's
a hurtin' feeling.

1191
01:12:14,418 --> 01:12:15,419
Mm-hm.

1192
01:12:16,795 --> 01:12:20,340
And I wish in my heart
that we'd have met sooner.

1193
01:12:20,507 --> 01:12:23,010
I would've liked to have saved
your mother from her fate.

1194
01:12:26,054 --> 01:12:27,890
I can still save you from yours.

1195
01:12:28,307 --> 01:12:30,601
No, you must have me confused.

1196
01:12:32,060 --> 01:12:34,354
I'm sad is all, but I
don't need no savin'.

1197
01:12:34,563 --> 01:12:37,232
Yes. Yes, you do.

1198
01:12:39,276 --> 01:12:40,569
You all do.

01:12:46,491 --> 01:12:47,951

01:14:35,267 --> 01:14:36,643
-Hell yeah.
-Mm.

1228
01:14:37,269 --> 01:14:39,029

You sure?

1230
01:14:41,106 --> 01:14:43,108
Okay. Well, then, shit.

1231
01:14:43,275 --> 01:14:45,194
Wanna go out there and
tell 'em to do a song?

1232
01:14:50,616 --> 01:14:51,950
Are you scared?

1233
01:14:54,453 --> 01:14:55,746
You're scared.

1234
01:14:55,913 --> 01:14:58,707
Nah. Just that you
somebody else's.

1235
01:14:59,416 --> 01:15:00,417
Hm.

1236
01:15:00,834 --> 01:15:03,212
So you rob trains and banks...

1237
01:15:04,046 --> 01:15:06,173
but you can't steal
this pussy for a night?

Sammie, this is
not your fault.

1364
01:21:51,161 --> 01:21:52,621
Is Stack really dead?

1365
01:21:55,791 --> 01:21:57,251
Did she say anything?

1366
01:21:58,043 --> 01:22:00,462
She said, "We gonna
kill all of you."

1367
01:22:00,629 --> 01:22:01,630
"We"?

1368
01:22:03,590 --> 01:22:04,591

1370
01:22:15,227 --> 01:22:16,562

1371
01:22:16,728 --> 01:22:18,313
Outside. Just for now...

1372
01:22:18,480 --> 01:22:21,316
Don't... touch him.

1373
01:22:23,193 --> 01:22:24,862
Nobody move him.

1374
01:22:25,028 --> 01:22:26,697
You shot her.

1375
01:22:26,864 --> 01:22:29,575
And she kept runnin'
like nothin' happened.

1376
01:22:30,284 --> 01:22:33,370
This a haint we're dealin'
with, Smoke. Or worse.

1377
01:22:33,537 --> 01:22:36,582
We gotta keep everybody
inside and the dead body out.

1378
01:22:36,748 --> 01:22:37,833

01:24:46,920 --> 01:24:48,005
Hold on.

1413
01:24:50,257 --> 01:24:51,425
What y'all doin'?

1414
01:24:51,592 --> 01:24:53,552
Just step aside and
let me on in, now.

1415
01:24:54,761 --> 01:24:56,013
Why you need him to do that?

1416
01:24:58,891 --> 01:25:00,684
You big and strong
enough to push past us.

1417
01:25:01,268 --> 01:25:02,628
Well, that wouldn't
be too polite,

1418
01:25:02,769 --> 01:25:03,812
now, would it, Miss Annie?

1419
01:25:05,731 --> 01:25:07,482
I don't know why I'm
talking to you anyway.

1420
01:25:07,649 --> 01:25:09,109
Probably your fish sandwich

1421
01:25:09,276 --> 01:25:10,756
messed up my guts
in the first place.

1422
01:25:10,944 --> 01:25:11,987
Usin' old, stale grease.

1423
01:25:12,196 --> 01:25:14,115
I ain't never used stale
grease, and you know it.

1424
01:25:14,198 --> 01:25:16,325
-Shut up, Annie. Smoke...
-Don't talk to him.

1425
01:25:16,491 --> 01:25:17,576
You talkin' to me right now.

1426
01:25:17,659 --> 01:25:19,244
Why you can't just
walk your big ass

1427
01:25:19,411 --> 01:25:20,771
up in here without
an invite, huh?

1428
01:25:22,789 --> 01:25:25,083
Go 'head. Admit to it.

1429
01:25:25,751 --> 01:25:26,793
Admit to what?

1430
01:25:27,794 --> 01:25:28,962
That you dead.

1431
01:25:29,630 --> 01:25:31,590
That one of them white
folks out there kill you,

1432
01:25:31,757 --> 01:25:32,966
and you a haint now.

1433
01:25:38,972 --> 01:25:40,933
Smoke, you listenin' to this?

1434
01:25:42,726 --> 01:25:44,937
Woman, this man
showed me kindness.

1435
01:25:45,103 --> 01:25:48,106
Employed me. Grabbed
me out the field.

1436
01:25:48,273 --> 01:25:49,733
Now, he say his
brother been killed.

1437
01:25:49,900 --> 01:25:50,901
The man needs comfort,

1438
01:25:51,068 --> 01:25:52,903
not you fillin' up his mind

1439
01:25:53,070 --> 01:25:55,656
with that old Lousiana
bayou bullshit you on.

1440
01:25:55,822 --> 01:25:58,492
Now, we out here playing games,

1441
01:25:58,659 --> 01:25:59,993
telling ghost stories

1442
01:26:00,160 --> 01:26:02,329
in place of doin'
what we ought to do.

1443
01:26:04,831 --> 01:26:06,500
And what is it we
s'pose to be doin'?

1444
01:26:08,377 --> 01:26:10,379
Bein' kind to one another!

1445
01:26:10,754 --> 01:26:14,258
And bein' polite. Now,
we is one peoples.

1446
01:26:14,424 --> 01:26:16,760
And we shouldn't go in,

1447
01:26:16,969 --> 01:26:18,679
bargin' into other
folks' places uninvited.

1448
01:26:18,846 --> 01:26:19,847
So...

1449
01:26:22,683 --> 01:26:24,226
You been in and
outta here all day.

1450
01:26:24,393 --> 01:26:26,436
Ain't never need an invite then.

1451
01:26:27,604 --> 01:26:30,274
Yeah, somethin' ain't addin' up.

1452
01:26:30,983 --> 01:26:33,026
Shit, Stack was my ride up here.

1453
01:26:33,527 --> 01:26:34,527
I 'posed to walk back?

1454
01:26:34,653 --> 01:26:35,863
That ain't my problem.

1455
01:26:37,823 --> 01:26:39,658
Well, it be, your own peoples.

1456
01:26:40,576 --> 01:26:42,119
And I thought you
was better than this,

1457
01:26:42,202 --> 01:26:43,482
but you just like the white man.

1458
01:26:47,624 --> 01:26:49,042
Can I at least get my money?

1459
01:26:49,209 --> 01:26:50,711
You did such a bang-up job...

1460
01:26:50,878 --> 01:26:52,421
now you wanna get paid
for what you ain't did?

1461
01:26:52,504 --> 01:26:53,631
Ain't nobody talkin'
to you, you old drunk.

1462
01:26:53,714 --> 01:26:55,632
-Shut your mouth.
-No, you shut the fuck up.

1463
01:26:56,216 --> 01:26:58,216
Don't give him shit, Smoke.
Don't give him nothin'.

1464
01:27:01,430 --> 01:27:02,431
Careful.

1465
01:27:16,945 --> 01:27:19,448
Smoke! Smoke!

1466
01:27:20,324 --> 01:27:21,825
-Oh, no!
-Smoke!

1467
01:27:41,303 --> 01:27:42,471
Close it! Close the door!

1468
01:27:42,554 --> 01:27:44,314
Close the door! What
the fuck? What the fuck?

1469
01:27:45,140 --> 01:27:46,266
He got you? Did he get you?

1470
01:27:46,433 --> 01:27:47,685
I'm all right, I'm all
right, I'm all right.

1471
01:27:47,768 --> 01:27:49,395
-What the hell was that?
-I don't know.

1472
01:27:49,478 --> 01:27:50,687
Hey. Hey.

1473
01:27:53,065 --> 01:27:54,608
Y'all smell anything?

1474
01:27:55,067 --> 01:27:56,068
No.

1475
01:27:57,152 --> 01:27:58,654
I think I shat myself.

1476
01:28:02,241 --> 01:28:04,160
How the hell he get up, huh?

1477
01:28:04,243 --> 01:28:05,327
I don't know. I don't know.

1478
01:28:05,410 --> 01:28:06,537
I shot the nigga in his head.

1479
01:28:06,620 --> 01:28:08,220
Cornbread pulled me
out the goddamn door.

1480
01:28:10,123 --> 01:28:11,458
Is someone in there?

1481
01:28:19,842 --> 01:28:21,176
Smoke.

1482
01:28:21,343 --> 01:28:22,343
Smoke!

1483
01:28:23,053 --> 01:28:24,054
Smoke?

1484
01:28:25,430 --> 01:28:26,431
Go on ahead.

1485
01:28:26,598 --> 01:28:28,198
Open up this door,
let me on out of here.

1486
01:28:36,650 --> 01:28:37,651
Stack...

1487
01:28:38,944 --> 01:28:39,945
Nigga, that's you?

1488
01:28:40,112 --> 01:28:41,530
Nah, fool, it's Jim Crow.

1489
01:28:41,697 --> 01:28:43,297
Nigga, of course it's
me. Open the door.

1490
01:28:44,116 --> 01:28:45,117
Stack...

1491
01:28:49,121 --> 01:28:51,290
How you feelin'?

1492
01:28:52,541 --> 01:28:54,001
Boy, you lost a lot of blood.

1493
01:28:55,127 --> 01:28:57,963
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

1494
01:29:02,593 --> 01:29:05,053
It was scary, and I'm
doing much better now.

1495
01:29:05,220 --> 01:29:07,264
I swear. On Mama grave.

1496
01:29:07,681 --> 01:29:09,349
I thought you
said he was dead.

1497
01:29:09,516 --> 01:29:12,477
He was. I checked his pulse.

1498
01:29:13,020 --> 01:29:14,813
Then what the fuck is
he doin' talkin' to us?

1499
01:29:14,980 --> 01:29:18,025
But this is good,
right? Means he's okay.

1500
01:29:19,067 --> 01:29:20,068
Smoke...

1501
01:29:21,195 --> 01:29:23,030
that ain't your brother.

1502
01:29:23,197 --> 01:29:24,990
Smoke, what that witch
out there talkin' 'bout?

1503
01:29:25,073 --> 01:29:26,825
You gonna let her get
in between us again?

1504
01:29:26,992 --> 01:29:27,993
What we been through...

1505
01:29:28,160 --> 01:29:29,620
German trenches, nigga.

1506
01:29:29,786 --> 01:29:31,205
Chicago gangways.

1507
01:29:32,915 --> 01:29:33,916
Oh, all right.

1508
01:29:34,082 --> 01:29:35,876
Y'all niggas gonna
pay for this shit.

1509
01:29:36,043 --> 01:29:38,295
Lockin' this pimp
in the closet, huh?

1510
01:29:38,462 --> 01:29:39,588
Huh? Open the door, Smoke!

1511
01:29:39,755 --> 01:29:41,298
Let me the fuck out
or I swear before God,

1512
01:29:41,381 --> 01:29:43,425
I'm layin' all you
sons of bitches down.

1513
01:29:43,592 --> 01:29:45,135
One by one!

1514
01:29:49,181 --> 01:29:52,392
Smoke. Come on, man.
Open the door, it's me.

1515
01:29:53,060 --> 01:29:54,728
You know I don't
like this shit, man.

1516
01:29:54,895 --> 01:29:56,480
Please, Smoke, let
me out of this room.

1517
01:29:56,647 --> 01:29:57,773
Smoke, please.

1518
01:30:00,776 --> 01:30:01,902
Annie, give me the key.

1519
01:30:03,153 --> 01:30:04,279
Stack?

1520
01:30:15,749 --> 01:30:16,750
Stop!

1521
01:30:19,336 --> 01:30:20,337
Hey!

1522
01:30:21,588 --> 01:30:22,589
Sammie!

1523
01:30:25,467 --> 01:30:26,760
Come on, get up.

1524
01:30:30,055 --> 01:30:31,849
What was in the jar?

1525
01:30:32,015 --> 01:30:33,308
Pickled garlic.

1526
01:30:34,434 --> 01:30:35,644
These ain't haints.

1527
01:30:36,895 --> 01:30:37,896
They're vampires.

1528
01:30:42,442 --> 01:30:45,070
Bo's out there. We
gotta go get him.

1529
01:30:45,237 --> 01:30:46,489
I'm the one who
sent him out there.

1530
01:30:46,572 --> 01:30:48,490
-Can't let you do that.
-He needs my help.

1531
01:30:48,657 --> 01:30:50,325
Bo know how to handle himself.

1532
01:30:50,492 --> 01:30:52,372
Probably got in that car
and got someplace safe.

1533
01:30:52,536 --> 01:30:53,954
Y'all ain't gonna keep
me from my husband.

1534
01:30:54,037 --> 01:30:56,206
Grace, we tryin' to keep
you alive right now.

1535
01:30:56,373 --> 01:30:58,458
We just gotta hole
up till sunrise.

1536
01:30:58,667 --> 01:30:59,668
Okay?

1537
01:31:02,462 --> 01:31:04,047
Now, we need...

1538
01:31:04,631 --> 01:31:05,632
garlic...

1539
01:31:07,593 --> 01:31:09,094
wood...

1540
01:31:11,305 --> 01:31:13,265
...silver, and holy water.

1541
01:31:13,599 --> 01:31:16,226
Shit might not kill 'em,
but it'll slow 'em down.

1542
01:31:18,103 --> 01:31:20,397
How could it move and
sound like Stack...

1543
01:31:21,273 --> 01:31:22,274
if it ain't Stack?

1544
01:31:22,649 --> 01:31:24,234
I only ever heard stories.

1545
01:31:24,401 --> 01:31:25,921
I ain't never come
across them myself.

1546
01:31:26,069 --> 01:31:27,487
What stories you heard?

1547
01:31:27,654 --> 01:31:30,866
How haints work. They switch
places with the soul of a man.

1548
01:31:32,492 --> 01:31:33,911
But vampires is different.

1549
01:31:35,454 --> 01:31:36,830
<i>Maybe the worst kind.</i>

1550
01:31:37,706 --> 01:31:39,666
The soul gets stuck in the body.

1551
01:31:40,375 --> 01:31:41,919
Can't rejoin the ancestors.

1552
01:31:42,085 --> 01:31:44,421
Cursed to live here
with all this hate.

1553
01:31:47,049 --> 01:31:49,176
Can't even feel the
warmth of a sunrise.

1554
01:31:51,178 --> 01:31:53,764
Okay then. Can we
bring him back?

1555
01:31:54,139 --> 01:31:55,939
If I killed the ones
that made him this way...

1556
01:31:56,058 --> 01:31:57,184
<i>Smoke...</i>

1557
01:31:57,351 --> 01:31:59,728
<i>They have a connection,
but they live on...</i>

1558
01:31:59,895 --> 01:32:02,272
even if the one that
made them is killed.

1559
01:32:02,439 --> 01:32:03,982
The best thing we can do for him

1560
01:32:04,149 --> 01:32:05,651
is free his spirit
from this curse.

1561
01:32:06,235 --> 01:32:07,903
They gotta be
killed, one by one.

1562
01:32:08,070 --> 01:32:09,488
And how the hell do we do that?

1563
01:32:10,697 --> 01:32:11,907
Sunlight.

1564
01:32:12,658 --> 01:32:14,451
A wooden stake to the heart.

1565
01:32:16,453 --> 01:32:18,080
The hell, Annie?

1566
01:32:18,413 --> 01:32:20,749
I kept that boy safe
all these years.

1567
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:23,710
<i>All over this world.</i>

1568
01:32:23,877 --> 01:32:24,878
Why tonight?

1569
01:32:26,296 --> 01:32:27,297
It's 'cause of me.

1570
01:32:28,090 --> 01:32:29,341
My daddy told me.

1571
01:32:30,133 --> 01:32:32,261
He said the Devil was comin'
on account of my music.

1572
01:32:32,386 --> 01:32:34,972
I had a gal once, vampire.

1573
01:32:35,138 --> 01:32:36,598
She was light skinneded, too.

1574
01:32:37,099 --> 01:32:38,892
That gal bit me
everywhere but my neck.

1575
01:32:41,562 --> 01:32:42,563
Sammie...

1576
01:32:43,897 --> 01:32:45,357
you don't worry
about a thing, hear?

1577
01:32:45,941 --> 01:32:48,110
Devil done came for
me plenty of times.

1578
01:32:48,277 --> 01:32:50,070
If he come knockin' tonight...

1579
01:32:52,072 --> 01:32:54,783
he gonna have to go through
his old friend Delta Slim

1580
01:32:54,950 --> 01:32:56,159
before he get to you.

1581
01:32:56,368 --> 01:32:57,995
That go for everybody in here.

1582
01:33:02,708 --> 01:33:04,710
If I get bit by one of them...

1583
01:33:04,877 --> 01:33:06,920
promise me, right now...

1584
01:33:07,045 --> 01:33:09,131
that you'll free
me 'fore I turn.

1585
01:33:09,464 --> 01:33:10,924
What you mean, "free you"?

1586
01:33:14,011 --> 01:33:15,291
I got somebody on the other side

1587
01:33:15,429 --> 01:33:16,680
waitin' for me.

1588
01:33:17,931 --> 01:33:19,474
They waitin' on you, too.

1589
01:33:29,526 --> 01:33:30,527
You understand?

1590
01:33:30,694 --> 01:33:32,238
Hey, come on, look at me.

1591
01:33:32,321 --> 01:33:33,841
I don't care about
what that shit say.

1592
01:33:33,947 --> 01:33:35,490
I'm gonna make sure
you get home safe.

1593
01:33:35,949 --> 01:33:37,951
Sammie! Smoke!

1594
01:33:38,619 --> 01:33:40,787
Well, who did this?
Was it Stack or Mary?

1595
01:33:40,954 --> 01:33:43,665
Nah. They ran straight
out. You saw them.

1596
01:33:43,832 --> 01:33:45,417
Well, who bit him, then?

1597
01:33:45,584 --> 01:33:47,336
We gotta get him out
before he wakes up.

1598
01:33:59,348 --> 01:34:00,390
Come on.

1599
01:34:00,557 --> 01:34:01,600

is one of them.

-Shut up.

01:36:52,104 --> 01:36:53,689
Eat, or I'll shoot.

1650
01:36:55,148 --> 01:36:57,026
Put the gun down, Smoke.
She ain't no damn vampire.

1651
01:36:57,109 --> 01:36:58,486
How the hell you know that?

1652
01:36:58,569 --> 01:37:00,028
Just eat the damn garlic, girl.

1653
01:37:00,195 --> 01:37:02,239
Smoke!

1654
01:37:02,406 --> 01:37:03,616
I'm trying to keep
you alive, boy.

1655
01:37:03,699 --> 01:37:04,700
You ain't to question me.

1656
01:37:05,117 --> 01:37:06,577
You a evil man.

1657
01:37:08,036 --> 01:37:09,580
No wonder the Devil come for us.

1658
01:37:36,148 --> 01:37:38,066
-Mm-mm.
-Hey, Slim.

1659
01:37:38,233 --> 01:37:39,234
What's goin' on, man?

1660
01:37:41,820 --> 01:37:42,988
Mm-mm. Mm-mm.

1661
01:37:43,071 --> 01:37:44,698
Slim?

1662
01:37:49,536 --> 01:37:51,246
What's goin' on, Slim?

1663
01:37:53,373 --> 01:37:54,958
I drank too much.

1664
01:37:56,084 --> 01:37:58,045
That goddamn beer
from Chicago.

1665
01:37:58,212 --> 01:38:00,380
My nerves all fucked up, Smoke.

1666
01:38:07,221 --> 01:38:08,388
I'm fine.

1667
01:38:10,474 --> 01:38:11,475
See?

1668
01:38:11,642 --> 01:38:13,268
You sure that was blood?

1669
01:38:35,123 --> 01:38:37,626
Hey. Hey, Smoke, let me in, man.

1670
01:38:40,003 --> 01:38:42,005
Huh. Lookit here.

1671
01:38:42,172 --> 01:38:43,423
Smoke, Smoke, let me in!

1672
01:38:44,299 --> 01:38:45,717
Smoke, I swear I
paid my tab, man.

1673
01:38:45,884 --> 01:38:47,010
That's what this about?

1674
01:38:47,261 --> 01:38:49,137
Smoke! Hey, Smoke!

1675
01:38:49,388 --> 01:38:50,806
Whatever you need, man!

1676
01:38:50,889 --> 01:38:53,475
Smoke! Some weird shit
going on out here, Smoke!

1677
01:38:53,642 --> 01:38:55,185
I know you hear me, Smoke!

1678
01:38:55,352 --> 01:38:57,354
Smoke, let me in!
Smoke, let me in!

1679
01:38:59,523 --> 01:39:00,732
Whoa, what the... Oh, shit.

1680
01:39:00,899 --> 01:39:02,985
Get off me!

1681
01:39:04,319 --> 01:39:05,988
-Close the door. Come on.
-Wait!

1682
01:39:06,697 --> 01:39:07,990
-Get off of me!
-Bo.

1683
01:39:08,365 --> 01:39:09,992
-Get your ass off of me!
-Hey, baby.

1684
01:39:10,367 --> 01:39:11,452
Come on outside, I
got the car started.

1685
01:39:11,535 --> 01:39:12,536
Let's go.

1686
01:39:16,081 --> 01:39:17,291
What is it, Grace?

1687
01:39:18,834 --> 01:39:20,194
He's killing him.

1688
01:39:21,044 --> 01:39:22,296
Oh, you talking about that?

1689
01:39:22,754 --> 01:39:24,256
Oh, don't worry about Cornbread.

1690
01:39:24,673 --> 01:39:27,384
He's just a little hungry,
that's all. Let's go.

1691
01:39:28,135 --> 01:39:29,720
Come on.

1692
01:39:33,473 --> 01:39:35,684
Come on and go. I got
the car all warmed up.

1693
01:39:41,231 --> 01:39:42,232
Or...

1694
01:39:44,651 --> 01:39:47,196
You let me back in there.

1695
01:39:48,572 --> 01:39:52,034
And I'll come in, and we
can grab our things...

1696
01:39:52,993 --> 01:39:54,328
and head home?

1697
01:39:54,870 --> 01:39:55,871
Don't listen to him.

1698
01:39:56,038 --> 01:39:57,957
Grace, we're gonna find a
way out of this, I promise.

1699
01:39:58,040 --> 01:40:00,167
I am your way out.

1700
01:40:02,628 --> 01:40:04,463
This world already
left you for dead.

1701
01:40:05,881 --> 01:40:09,092
Won't let you build.
Won't let you fellowship.

1702
01:40:09,593 --> 01:40:12,513
We will do just that. Together.

1703
01:40:14,181 --> 01:40:15,474
Forever.

1704
01:40:15,641 --> 01:40:17,267
It's better this way, baby.

1705
01:40:18,519 --> 01:40:21,563
So why don't you go
ahead, invite us in.

1706
01:40:22,022 --> 01:40:23,662
You should listen
to him, Grace.

1707
01:40:23,774 --> 01:40:25,734
Or listen to me.

1708
01:40:25,901 --> 01:40:27,986
'Cause I know
everything he knows now.

1709
01:40:28,612 --> 01:40:30,906
And I want you to
let us in there.

1710
01:40:32,074 --> 01:40:33,492
Or we gon' go to
the grocery store.

1711
01:40:33,659 --> 01:40:35,494
We gon' pay little Lisa a visit.

1712
01:40:35,661 --> 01:40:36,662
No, no,

1713
01:40:36,828 --> 01:40:38,413
-don't you fucking dare!
-No, no, no.

1714
01:40:38,580 --> 01:40:39,748
-No!
-Oh, yeah, Grace.

1715
01:40:39,831 --> 01:40:41,708
I know everything now.

1716
01:40:57,224 --> 01:40:58,559
This can't be real.

1717
01:40:59,893 --> 01:41:02,604
You the Devil. Ain't you?

1718
01:41:03,063 --> 01:41:04,106
Sammie!

1719
01:41:05,983 --> 01:41:07,776
You the one I came for.

1720
01:41:08,402 --> 01:41:09,444
<i>I sensed you.</i>

1721
01:41:09,611 --> 01:41:12,614
<i>I wanna see my people
again. I'm trapped here.</i>

1722
01:41:13,115 --> 01:41:14,783
<i>But your gifts can
bring 'em to me.</i>

1723
01:41:16,660 --> 01:41:18,746
Y'all give him to me now.
Just give me little Sammie...

1724
01:41:18,829 --> 01:41:19,913
we'll let y'all live.

1725
01:41:22,541 --> 01:41:24,585
Whoa, whoa. Hey,
hey, hey, easy. Easy.

1726
01:41:24,751 --> 01:41:27,337
I'm gon' tell you somethin',
you goddamn peckerwood.

1727
01:41:28,630 --> 01:41:29,756
You can't have him.

1728
01:41:30,591 --> 01:41:34,052
He belongs to us.
He belongs with us.

1729
01:41:34,803 --> 01:41:36,638
And I ain't gonna
let that happen.

1730
01:41:36,847 --> 01:41:38,182
You can't save him, Smoke,

1731
01:41:38,348 --> 01:41:39,948
no more than you could
save your brother.

1732
01:41:46,565 --> 01:41:48,483
You ain't safe here.

1733
01:41:48,650 --> 01:41:51,278
No matter how many guns,
or how much money...

1734
01:41:51,445 --> 01:41:53,572
They gon' take it from
you when they want.

1735
01:41:54,198 --> 01:41:55,657
You built somethin'
here tonight,

1736
01:41:55,824 --> 01:41:57,075
and it was beautiful.

1737
01:41:57,242 --> 01:41:59,870
But it was built on a lie.

1738
01:42:01,205 --> 01:42:06,001
Hogwood, well, he's the Grand
Dragon of the Ku Klux Klan.

1739
01:42:06,168 --> 01:42:08,003
That's his motherfuckin' nephew.

1740
01:42:09,254 --> 01:42:11,465
And they was always
gon' kill you.

1741
01:42:11,632 --> 01:42:13,592
<i>I just happened to show
up at the right place</i>

1742
01:42:13,759 --> 01:42:15,093
<i>at the right time.</i>

1743
01:42:15,260 --> 01:42:16,678
He tellin' the truth, Smoke.

1744
01:42:17,763 --> 01:42:19,765
I can see his memories.

1745
01:42:19,932 --> 01:42:21,975
Smoke, that ain't your brother.

1746
01:42:22,142 --> 01:42:24,770
This wasn't no juke
joint. No club.

1747
01:42:25,479 --> 01:42:28,232
This here's a slaughterhouse.

1748
01:42:28,440 --> 01:42:30,025
It's a goddamn killing floor.

1749
01:42:30,192 --> 01:42:31,818
But what Uncle
Hogwood don't know

1750
01:42:31,985 --> 01:42:34,530
is we're gonna start
ourselves a new clan,

1751
01:42:34,696 --> 01:42:35,948
based on love.

1752
01:42:37,282 --> 01:42:38,283
Now that we got numbers,

1753
01:42:38,492 --> 01:42:39,702
we'll probably go

1754
01:42:39,785 --> 01:42:41,703

1755
01:42:41,870 --> 01:42:43,163
Why can't y'all just go?

1756
01:42:43,330 --> 01:42:45,582
'Cause we're not
leavin' without y'all.

1757
01:42:46,708 --> 01:42:49,127
We're family. Ain't that right?

1758
01:42:49,294 --> 01:42:53,757
I know it sound crazy,
but after we kill y'all...

1759
01:42:53,924 --> 01:42:56,343

right here on Earth.

1760
01:42:56,510 --> 01:42:57,670
Mm.

1761
01:43:00,722 --> 01:43:01,723
Oh.

1762
01:43:02,641 --> 01:43:03,642
Hey there.

1763
01:43:08,063 --> 01:43:09,523
-Come on.
-Welcome.

1764
01:43:12,860 --> 01:43:15,696
Hey, hey, hey. Look at me.

1765
01:43:15,863 --> 01:43:17,114
Hey, let me tell you somethin'.

1766
01:43:17,281 --> 01:43:19,157
Let me tell you goddamn
somethin', nigga.

1767
01:43:19,741 --> 01:43:20,826
The Stack I know

1768
01:43:21,410 --> 01:43:23,412
ain't fellowshipping
with no goddamn devil.

1769
01:43:23,579 --> 01:43:25,414
Fuck you, nigger. It is me.

1770
01:43:25,581 --> 01:43:27,124
Elias Moore.

1771
01:43:27,291 --> 01:43:29,210
And I'm talkin' to my big
brother right now, Slim...

1772
01:43:29,293 --> 01:43:31,211
so I'mma kindly ask you
to shut the fuck up.

1773
01:43:34,298 --> 01:43:35,674
We was never gonna be free.

1774
01:43:36,175 --> 01:43:37,468
We've been running
around everywhere

1775
01:43:37,551 --> 01:43:38,677
looking for freedom.

1776
01:43:39,386 --> 01:43:42,306
You know damn well you
was never gonna find it.

1777
01:43:43,098 --> 01:43:44,349
Until this.

1778
01:43:44,933 --> 01:43:47,519
This is the way.

1779
01:43:48,145 --> 01:43:49,605
Together.

1780
01:43:49,771 --> 01:43:51,190
Forever.

1781
01:43:53,901 --> 01:43:55,861
And I ain't doing
this shit without ya.

1782
01:43:56,862 --> 01:43:58,572
There is no me without you.

1783
01:44:00,824 --> 01:44:02,284
What's it gon' be?

1784
01:44:04,620 --> 01:44:06,538
-No. No, no, no.
-Hey.

1785
01:44:06,705 --> 01:44:07,956
We're closin' the door.

1786
01:44:08,332 --> 01:44:09,972
-No. No.
-No, man.

1787
01:44:14,922 --> 01:44:16,381
No vision.

1788
01:44:24,223 --> 01:44:26,225
He said he was gonna
take our daughter.

1789
01:44:26,391 --> 01:44:27,476
You can't believe him.

1790
01:44:27,559 --> 01:44:28,894
He was just trying to
get you to let him in.

1791
01:44:28,977 --> 01:44:30,337
He ain't threatened
your children!

1792
01:44:30,479 --> 01:44:31,959
We just gotta stay
through the night.

1793
01:44:32,856 --> 01:44:35,317
And what? Let him
kill my family?

1794
01:44:35,943 --> 01:44:37,069
Kill the whole town?

1795
01:44:37,528 --> 01:44:39,404
Turn everybody to monsters?

1796
01:44:40,155 --> 01:44:42,407
That white devil spoke Chinese.

1797
01:44:42,616 --> 01:44:44,409
He got in Bo's mind.

1798
01:44:45,869 --> 01:44:47,496
We gotta stop 'em, Smoke.

1799
01:44:48,163 --> 01:44:50,082
We gotta get 'em
before they get away.

1800
01:44:50,249 --> 01:44:53,085
Grace, just slow down.
Give me a second to think.

1801
01:44:53,252 --> 01:44:55,629
What? Ain't you a soldier?

1802
01:44:57,756 --> 01:44:58,756
Yeah?

1803
01:45:03,095 --> 01:45:05,556
Didn't you just shoot two
men for touching your truck?

1804
01:45:06,890 --> 01:45:08,183
They killed your brother.

1805
01:45:09,017 --> 01:45:10,644
Made Stack one of 'em.

1806
01:45:10,769 --> 01:45:12,187
And my Bo.

1807
01:45:12,813 --> 01:45:15,232
Said they was gon' kill Lisa.

1808
01:45:15,399 --> 01:45:18,193
If now ain't go time,
then I don't know what is.

1809
01:45:19,987 --> 01:45:21,071
We supposed to wait the night

1810
01:45:21,154 --> 01:45:23,031
while they take more
of our loved ones?

1811
01:45:23,198 --> 01:45:24,283
Make 'em demons?

1812
01:45:24,575 --> 01:45:25,868
They don't look like
they leavin', Grace.

1813
01:45:25,951 --> 01:45:27,911
Oh, shut your
drunk ass up, Slim!

1814
01:45:28,078 --> 01:45:30,122
I ain't drunk right now.

1815
01:45:30,289 --> 01:45:32,165
You need to watch
your mouth, woman.

1816
01:45:33,667 --> 01:45:34,668
What you doin'?

1817
01:45:34,835 --> 01:45:36,170
-Stop that. Come on.
-No!

1818
01:45:37,129 --> 01:45:38,255

Go! Go!

1901
01:50:38,347 --> 01:50:40,516
Keep running. Right
to the sunrise.

1902
01:50:58,700 --> 01:51:01,620
I had it all worked out. Then
you go on and kill Annie.

1903
01:51:01,787 --> 01:51:02,907
Fuck is wrong with you, man?

1904
01:51:06,542 --> 01:51:08,168
I want your stories.

1905
01:51:08,794 --> 01:51:10,420
And I want your songs.

1906
01:51:11,213 --> 01:51:13,173
And you gon' have mine.

1907
01:51:13,632 --> 01:51:14,967
Our Father...

1908
01:51:15,676 --> 01:51:17,469
which art in Heaven...

1909
01:51:18,053 --> 01:51:19,847
hallowed be thy name...

1910
01:51:20,764 --> 01:51:22,349
Thy kingdom come...

1911
01:51:23,559 --> 01:51:25,018
thy will be done...

1912
01:51:27,062 --> 01:51:28,814
On Earth, as it is in heaven.

1913
01:51:29,940 --> 01:51:31,440
Give us this day
our daily bread...

1914
01:51:31,441 --> 01:51:32,734
Our daily bread...

1915
01:51:32,901 --> 01:51:35,487
and forgive us our trespasses...

1916
01:51:35,654 --> 01:51:38,866
as we forgive those who
trespass against us.

1917
01:51:39,950 --> 01:51:42,578
And lead us not
into temptation...

1918
01:51:43,161 --> 01:51:44,955
but deliver us from evil.

1919
01:51:46,456 --> 01:51:47,541
Amen.

1920
01:51:48,500 --> 01:51:50,169
Long ago...

1921
01:51:50,335 --> 01:51:52,211
the men who stole
my father's land

1922
01:51:52,212 --> 01:51:54,131
forced these words upon us.

1923
01:51:54,298 --> 01:51:56,215
I hated those men,

1924
01:51:56,216 --> 01:51:58,176
but the words still
bring me comfort.

1925
01:52:05,684 --> 01:52:07,186
Hey! Hey. Stay your ass down.

1926
01:52:08,020 --> 01:52:09,855
I'm bored of you, man.

1927
01:52:10,522 --> 01:52:11,607
Mother...

1928
01:52:11,899 --> 01:52:14,901
Those men lied to
themselves and lied to us.

1929
01:52:17,863 --> 01:52:20,949
They told stories of a God
above and a Devil below.

1930
01:52:21,366 --> 01:52:25,621
And lies of a dominion of
man over beast and Earth.

1931
01:52:49,520 --> 01:52:51,313
Sorry I couldn't keep you safe.

1932
01:52:51,939 --> 01:52:54,942
Don't be sorry. You always did.

1933
01:52:56,235 --> 01:52:58,987
We are earth and beast and god.

1934
01:52:59,154 --> 01:53:00,989
We are woman and man.

1935
01:53:01,156 --> 01:53:04,117
We are connected, you and I...

1936
01:53:05,369 --> 01:53:07,203
to everything.

1937
01:53:21,885 --> 01:53:23,303
Shit!

1938
01:53:23,679 --> 01:53:25,013
No.

1939
01:53:35,399 --> 01:53:38,735
You will taste the
sweet pain of death.

1940
01:53:39,069 --> 01:53:44,157
We will make beautiful
music together.

1941
01:53:58,964 --> 01:54:00,883
-He get you? Did he get you?
-No!

1942
01:54:08,807 --> 01:54:10,058
I'm here. I'm here.

1943
01:54:18,317 --> 01:54:19,677
-The sun!
-The sun!

1944
01:55:26,343 --> 01:55:27,344
Want help?

1945
01:55:38,272 --> 01:55:39,273
Go home.

1946
01:55:41,108 --> 01:55:42,568
And bury that fuckin' guitar.

1947
01:55:50,450 --> 01:55:51,451
I can't.

1948
01:55:53,370 --> 01:55:54,788
It's Charley Patton's.

1949
01:55:56,248 --> 01:55:57,249
What?

1950
01:55:58,667 --> 01:56:00,002
Boy, who told you that?

1951
01:56:04,173 --> 01:56:05,174
Stack.

1952
01:56:07,426 --> 01:56:08,969
Said y'all won it off him.

1953
01:56:12,306 --> 01:56:13,974
Lyin' son of a bitch.

1954
01:56:16,685 --> 01:56:18,270
That's our daddy guitar.

1955
01:56:20,480 --> 01:56:21,732
Hey. Come here.

1956
01:56:23,358 --> 01:56:24,651
Be strong, you hear me?

1957
01:56:26,361 --> 01:56:27,362
Hear me?

1958
01:56:29,990 --> 01:56:31,533
I got some business to handle.

1959
01:56:33,368 --> 01:56:35,829
Be strong. You hear?

1960
01:57:04,399 --> 01:57:06,443
<i>♪Little light of mine ♪</i>

1961
01:57:07,194 --> 01:57:09,488

01:58:39,620 --> 01:58:40,740

1964
01:58:40,871 --> 01:58:42,246
or any one of your Klan buddies

1965
01:58:42,247 --> 01:58:44,041
cross our property line...

1966
01:58:44,791 --> 01:58:46,668
<i>we gonna kill 'em
right where they stand.</i>

1967
01:58:49,046 --> 01:58:50,714
Klan don't exist no more.

1968
01:58:51,256 --> 01:58:53,008
Little coon huntin'
this morning, boys.

1969
01:58:53,091 --> 01:58:54,842
Love skinnin' me a nigger

1970
01:58:54,843 --> 01:58:56,011
first thing of the day.

1971
01:58:56,762 --> 01:58:58,347
Gettin' a little too
uppity around here.

1972
01:58:58,430 --> 01:59:00,057
Time to teach these
boys a lesson.

1973
01:59:00,682 --> 01:59:01,934
Club Juke, huh?

1974
01:59:02,851 --> 01:59:04,728
Grand openin' and grand closin'.

1975
01:59:05,604 --> 01:59:07,648
-Let's do it. Open it up.
-Yeah.

1976
01:59:12,778 --> 01:59:13,779
Sammie!

1977
01:59:18,408 --> 01:59:19,409
Come, son.

1978
01:59:25,165 --> 01:59:26,208
Door's locked.

1979
01:59:26,792 --> 01:59:27,793
Try the front.

1980
01:59:28,335 --> 01:59:30,170
Drop the guitar, Samuel.

1981
01:59:32,631 --> 01:59:34,967
This one is, too.

1982
01:59:35,592 --> 01:59:37,176
Where the hell is
it comin' from?

1983
01:59:37,177 --> 01:59:38,737
Niggers is shootin' at us!

1984
01:59:47,646 --> 01:59:48,856
Kill his Black ass!

1985
02:00:08,083 --> 02:00:10,210
Drive! Drive, damn it, drive!

1986
02:00:53,170 --> 02:00:54,963
Drop the guitar, Samuel.

1987
02:00:55,130 --> 02:00:57,591
Put it down. In the name of God.

1988
02:00:59,218 --> 02:01:00,427
You tell them...

1989
02:01:01,637 --> 02:01:02,804
<i>"my heart...</i>

1990
02:01:04,181 --> 02:01:05,557
my voice...

1991
02:01:06,517 --> 02:01:07,809
my soul...

1992
02:01:08,769 --> 02:01:10,729
belongeth to the Lord."

1993
02:01:12,981 --> 02:01:13,982
You got a cigarette?

1994
02:01:14,525 --> 02:01:15,943
You go to hell, nigger.

1995
02:02:10,038 --> 02:02:11,623
Hmm.

1996
02:02:13,792 --> 02:02:14,960
Elijah.

1997
02:02:16,044 --> 02:02:18,338
You put that cig out,
you can hold her.

1998
02:02:25,721 --> 02:02:28,140
I don't want any of that
smoke to get on her.

1999
02:02:39,234 --> 02:02:41,278
Hey. Listen...

2000
02:02:43,447 --> 02:02:45,407
I got money. Huh?

2001
02:03:33,121 --> 02:03:34,373
Papa's here.

2002
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:43,085
Hey, boss...

2003
02:05:43,335 --> 02:05:44,336
we got two out there.

2004
02:05:44,503 --> 02:05:45,504
I told 'em we closed,

2005
02:05:45,671 --> 02:05:46,505
but they offered a
couple hundred bucks.

2006
02:05:46,672 --> 02:05:48,715
-That okay with you?
-That don't bother me none.

2007
02:05:52,261 --> 02:05:53,741
Come on in.

2008
02:06:12,531 --> 02:06:14,199
Vampires is different.

2009
02:06:14,366 --> 02:06:16,159
<i>Maybe the worst kind.</i>

2010
02:06:16,785 --> 02:06:18,204
<i>But they live on,</i>

2011
02:06:18,287 --> 02:06:20,539
<i>even if the one that
made them is killed.</i>

2012
02:06:21,248 --> 02:06:23,542
<i>They gotta be
killed, one by one.</i>

2013
02:06:28,297 --> 02:06:30,132
I'll have whatever
the old man havin'.

2014
02:06:48,525 --> 02:06:49,568
Hm.

2015
02:06:53,655 --> 02:06:54,656
How?

2016
02:06:55,324 --> 02:06:57,784
I guess I was the one person
he just couldn't kill.

2017
02:06:57,951 --> 02:07:00,370
<i>He made me promise to
stay away from you.</i>

2018
02:07:00,579 --> 02:07:02,497
Let you live out your life.

2019
02:07:13,175 --> 02:07:14,968
It won't be long for you, huh?

2020
02:07:17,471 --> 02:07:19,473
I could make it so that
you could stick around.

2021
02:07:20,140 --> 02:07:21,475
Keep tourin'.

2022
02:07:22,142 --> 02:07:23,143
Keep livin'.

2023
02:07:24,102 --> 02:07:25,103
No pain.

2024
02:07:28,023 --> 02:07:30,234
I think I've seen
enough of this place.

2025
02:07:31,818 --> 02:07:33,070
Hm.

2026
02:07:34,154 --> 02:07:36,406
You know, we got every
single one of your records.

2027
02:07:36,949 --> 02:07:38,325
I don't like that electric shit

2028
02:07:38,492 --> 02:07:39,701
as much as the real.

2029
02:07:39,868 --> 02:07:41,119
Yeah.

2030
02:07:41,286 --> 02:07:42,746
I miss the real.

2031
02:07:44,081 --> 02:07:46,583
Recordings from back then
sound like a pile of dogshit.

2032
02:07:49,461 --> 02:07:50,754
How about it, Sammie?

2033
02:07:52,756 --> 02:07:54,299
You still got the real in you?

wake up paralyzed...

2044
02:09:35,025 --> 02:09:36,527
reliving that night.

2045
02:09:38,278 --> 02:09:40,322
But before the sun went down...

2046
02:09:42,324 --> 02:09:44,701
I think that was the
best day of my life.

2047
02:09:46,787 --> 02:09:48,372
Was it like that for you?

2048
02:09:52,626 --> 02:09:54,002
No doubt about it.

2049
02:09:55,796 --> 02:09:57,047

2050
02:09:58,632 --> 02:10:00,133
I love you.

2051
02:10:01,218 --> 02:10:02,845
Last time I seen the sun.

2052
02:10:05,430 --> 02:10:07,015
And just for a few hours...

2053
02:10:09,184 --> 02:10:10,269
